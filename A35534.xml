            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OTHO Count of Naſſau, who lived about ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince, and had two Wives; with the firſt of whom he had the Province of Gueldres, and with the other that of Zutphen. About three hundred years after a ſecond Count</p>
            <p>OTHO of Naſſau married the Counteſs of Vranden, whereby he became poſſeſt of ſeveral other Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Netherlands. In the Year 1404.</p>
            <p>Engilbert who was his Grandchild married the Heireſs of the Town of Breda and Loeke, and was Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to</p>
            <p>Engilbert 2d Earl of Naſſau, who in 1491. was by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42023:4"/>Maximilian King of the Romans, going into Hungary, made Governour, Lieutenant and Captain General of Flanders, and afterwards in 1501. Arch-Duke Philip going into Spain, conſtituted him Governour General of the Netherlands, an experienced Prince both in War and Peace, but dying Childleſs, left his Brother</p>
            <p>John his large Territories; this John had two Sons, upon Henry the eldeſt he beſtowed all his Poſſeſſions in the Low-Countries, and to his youngeſt Son Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam he bequeathed all his Inheritance in Germany; By the earneſt Endeavours of Henry Naſſau, Charles the 5th was advanced to the Empire, againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Francis I. the French King, and at his Coronation placed the Crown on his Head; And yet when upon concluding Peace between theſe two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, Henry was ſent by the Emperor to do Homage to King Francis for the County of Flanders and Artois, that Prince forgetting former differences, and being fully ſenſible of his extraordinary Merits, married him to Claudia, only Siſter to Philibert Chalon Prince of Orange, by which Marriage his only Son Revens of Orange and Chalons, became Prince of Orange.</p>

            <p>The Emperor Charles the 5th having a favour for the Houſe of Orange, and received great ſervices from them, was concerned that the young Prince William ſhould be educated in the Reformed Religion, and therefore took him, with much regret from his Father, and endeavoured to inſtruct him in the Romiſh Faith, but afterward the former Opinions, which he had ſuckt in with his Mothers Milk, prevailed upon him, ſo that he became an earneſt Profeſſor of Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42023:4"/>
            <p>William Count of Naſſau his Father had five Sons and ſeven Daughters by Juliana Counteſs of Stolberg.</p>
            <p>WILLIAM the eldeſt was born in 1533. at the Caſtle of Dillemberg in the County of Naſſau, and being taken from his Father by the Emperor Charles, as we ſaid, he became a great Favourite by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wiſdom and Modeſty, ſo that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror confeſt this young Prince often furniſht him with notions and hints he ſhould elſe never have thought of, and upon giving of private Audiences to Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors when the Prince would diſcreetly offer to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, the Emperor mildly remanded him, ſaving, <hi>Stay Prince,</hi> and it was admired by the whole Court, that a Prince not above twenty years old, ſhould be intruſted with all the Secrets of the Empire, and carry the Imperial Crown upon his reſignation, to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ferdinand, though the Prince with ſome relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy ſeemed to refuſe the Imployment, by alledging, That it was no ways proper for him to carry to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Crown which his Uncle Henry of Naſſau had ſet upon his Head. Yea the Emperor had ſo much confidence in his Conduct, that in the abſence of the D. of Savoy his General of the Low Countries, though the Prince were not above 22 years old, yet contrary to the Advice of all his Council, rejecting all other experienc'd Generals, he conſtituted him Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo, who managed that great Imploy with ſuch diſcretion and courage, that he cauſed Philipville and Charlemont to be built in the fight of the French Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was then commanded by Admiral Caſtillon that great Captain.</p>
            <p>Theſe Magnanimous actions cauſed the Emperor to recommend the Prince of Orage to Philip II. his Son, but his Virtue and Courage were ſo emulated by the Spaniards, that all his moſt innocent words and actions were miſinterpreted, and the oppoſition that the Provinces made to the Kings Will and Pleaſure in defence of their Priviledges were attributed to his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42023:5"/>contrivance; which King Philip made him ſenſible of when he was imbarking from Fluſhing for Spain, charging him with preventing all his private Intrigues, with a furious countenance; And when the Prince mildly replyed, that all had been done by the motion of the States themſelves; the King ſhaking him by the wriſt replyed? <hi>No, not the States, but You, You, You, are the Occaſion of it;</hi> Which ſevere reproach in publick, ſo diſguſted the Prince that he ſuddenly left the King without further Ceremony, only wiſhing him a good Voyage, and ſo left him in the middle of Fluſhing, which he knew had much reſpect for him. And that which increaſed the Princes indignation againſt the Spaniſh Government, was that he ſaw himſelf deprived of the Government of the Netherlands which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors always enjoyed, and Cardinal Granville his inplacable Adverſary put in his place, which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of King Philip diſobliged both the Nobility and People, who hated the pride of Philip as much as they admired the affability of his Father Charles, which was much increaſed when the States (who much dreaded the Spaniſh inſolency,) in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at Gaunt, deſiring the King to withdraw his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Troops out of the Provinces, and intruſt the Natives with the Fortified places; and not advance Forreign Miniſters to the Government. The King was ſo far incenſed thereat that he ordered his Siſter Margaret of Auſtria, to ſet up the Spaniſh Inquiſition; and to make Diverſe new Biſhops.</p>
            <p>And theſe were the principal cauſes of the defection and terrible diſorders that followed: For the People abhorring the name of the Inquiſition, and the new Biſhops as members of it; and the Nobility being highly incenſed at the imperious temper of Granville, after having long ſuffered under his Arrogance, at length the Prince of Orange, Count Horn and Count Egmont ſent King Philip word,
<q>That unleſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the Cardinal out of the Low Countries, his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42023:5"/>violent Counſels which were ſo much abhorred by all, would certainly occaſion a Revolt in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</q> This with much regret was done, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe than he was deſigned in his room, the Bloody Duke of Alva, with an Army of Spaniards and Italians, which the Prince and Nobility being ſenſible was to take revenge for the affront to Granville; the Prince deſired the Governeſs to be diſmiſſed from his Governments of Holland, Zealand, Utrecht and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, which the Dutcheſs refuſed, but deſired him to remove his brother Count Lodowick from his Perſon, as being ſuſpected to give him bad Council, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to take a new Oath of Allegiance to King Philip; both which he denied; and as to the laſt alledged,
<q>That ſuch an Oath would oblige him to extirpate Hereticks, and might compel him to put his own Wife to Death who was a Proteſtant, and that if he ſhould take another Oath, it might be thought he had broken the firſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Governeſs being very zealous for ſetling the Inquiſition and the new Biſhops, about 400 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Prince Lewis of Naſſaw in the head of them, and ſeveral other Nobles; preſented a Petition againſt it, and were thoſe, who were afterward called Gueſe or Beggars, ſo Nick-named for their plain apparel by Count Barlemont a Favourite to the Dutcheſs; which though given in ſcorn, did much advance the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that followed and ſtrengthened he Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges Party: For their Petition being abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, theſe Gentlemen cauſed Medals to be made with the Kings Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ture on one ſide, and a Beggars Diſh and Wallet on the other; with this inſcription? <hi>Faithful to God and the King even to the carrying of the Wallet;</hi> intimating they were better Subjects in the King than Barlemont and his Adherents. And the Prince of Orange with the other Lords perceiving their Petition ſlighted, conſulted their own safety, moſt of them were for taking Arms to oppoſe the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42023:6"/>Landing of the Spaniards in the Neitherlands, ſince by intercepted Letters they plainly diſcovered the deſign was to ruine and deſtroy them. But Count Egmont Governour of Flanders and Artois oppoſed it, and being confident of his own good ſervices, adviſed them to rely upon the Kings Clemency and Mercy; To which the Prince of Ornge reply'd,
<q>That the Kings Mercy upon which he truſted would be his ruine, and that the Spaniards would make a Bridge of him to come into the Low Countries, and then break him.</q> At which words imbracing the Count as as if foreſeeing they ſhould never meet again, they parted with Tears in their Eyes: The Prince inſtantly went with his Family to his Town of Breda, only he left his Eldeſt Son Philip to Study in Lovain, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to Dillemberg the Ancient ſeat of the Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaws.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Duke of Alva with an Army of old Spaniſh and Italian Souldiers came into the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and Count Egmont waiting upon him, he ſaid aloud; <hi>Behold the great Lutheran:</hi> Yet the Count took no notice of it, but preſented him with two fine Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The Duke being arrived at Bruſſels produced his Commiſſion, whereby he was made abſolute Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all Cauſes whatſoever: He then diſmiſt the Aſſembly of the States, and conſtituted a Court of Twelve Men, who were to inſpect into the Troubles, They ſoon impriſon'd a great number of People of all Degrees and Qualities, and 18. Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were put to death at Bruſſels, and the Counts Egmont and Horn impriſoned, and ſoon after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the Market place of that City; the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much pitied by the people for his fond credulity, who rejoiced at the ſafety of the Prince of Orange: And Cardinal Granville who was then at Rome, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe proceedings, asked the Meſſenger, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke had taken <hi>Silence,</hi> which was a name given to the Prince for ſecrecy and few words; Who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42023:6"/>replying no;
<q>Nay ſays Granville, if that Fiſh has eſcapt the Net, The Duke of Alva's draught is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Cruel and Barbarous proceedings of this new Governour cauſed a great many to leave the Countrey, who were ſummoned to appear before the bloody Council of Twelve at a certain day, and upon their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal all their Eſtates were Confiſcated; Among others the Prince of Orange, Count Culenburgh and other Lords were cited; The Prince refuſed, alledging,
<q>That being of the Order of the Golden Fleece, he could not be judged by any but the King and the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of that Order.</q> He likewiſe appealed to the Emperor Maximilian, brother to King Philip, and other German Princes, imploring their aid, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of his reaſons, and declared their diſlike of the proceedings of the Duke of Alva: The time for the Princes appearing being expired, his Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were all declared to be forfeited, a Spaniſh Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was put into Breda, and his Eldeſt Son Philip William was ſent to Spain to be educated in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion, and alſo for an Hoſtage for his Father.</p>
            <p>And thus King Philip by theſe curſed Counſels, and the Rigorous uſage of his Subjects, was himſelf the occaſion of the loſs of the United Netherlands; who finding all their Priviledges violated and their utter extirpation determined, they reſolved to throw off this intolerable yoak and afterwards in ſome of their Enſigns had this Motto; <hi>We will either recover our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or periſh in tht Attempt.</hi> And the Prince of Orange obſerving himſelf ſo roughly and unjuſtly uſed, being reproached as a publick Enemy, and expoſed to the malice of his implacable Adverſaries, having his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Son, and his great Eſtate raviſhed from him, he thought it high time to defend his Honour and his Life, by force of Arms; and to engage for Religion and Liberty in the Common quarrel of his Countrey. And thereupon he raiſed an Army in Germany
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42023:7"/>which he ſent unto Friz and under his brother Lewis and Adolphus of Naſſaw; and being met by Count Aremburgh with a conſiderable Force, a battle fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, wherein the Naſſovians gained a conſiderable Victory, the Spaniſh Army being totally routed, and Arembergh himſelf with the principal Commanders ſlain, and all their Cannon, Baggage, and a great ſumm of Money ſent to pay the Souldiers taken. This defeat happened in 1568. But Count Lowis enjoyed this Victory very little, for the Duke of Alva purſuing him, fell upon him juſt at the time when the Germans were all in a mutiny for their pay who rather choſe to be miſerably ſlain than to defend themſelves, ſo that ſix thouſand were killed or drowned, Adolphus hardly making his eſcape.</p>
            <p>The Prince nothing diſcouraged at this misfortune, raiſed another Army of Twenty eight thouſand French and Germans, and publiſhed a Declaration wherein he cleared his Innocence of thoſe crimes objected againſt him, charging the Duke and the Council of Bloud with the Cauſes of the War, and then paſſing the Rhyne by tying his Horſes together to break the force of the River, the Foot arrived ſilently in the night to the other Shore, which ſo ſurprized that Duke of Alva, that he would not believe it at firſt, ſaying, <hi>Sure yo do not think them an Army of Birds.</hi> Arriving thus into Brabant, he offered Alva Battel, which the other declined; ſo that after 29 ſeveral attempts to engage him to a Combate, and the City's not revolting to the Prince as he expected, and the Germans being again ready to mutiny for want of Pay, it was thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to diſmiſs his Army, paying part of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas by the ſale of his Plate, Artillery and Baggage, and engaging his Principality of Orange to his chief Officers for the remainder; yet before their diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he routed eighteen Companies of the Enemies Foot, and three hundred Horſe of the Spaniards near Cambray, moſt of the Commanders being taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and the Duke of Alva's Son ſlain.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42023:7"/>
            <p>After this with only 1200 Horſe the Prince and his two Brothers went into France to the Aſſiſtance of the Proteſtants againſt the Duke of Guize and his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, where he was very ſucceſsful in ſeveral Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at length by the Advice of the great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Coligni he gave out Commiſſions to ſeveral Perſons of Quality, Fugitives of the Low Countries to infeſt the Spaniards by Sea, by which means he ſoon became Maſter of all Holland and Zealand. The Germans being driven out of the Netherlands, the D. of Alva, as if he had conſpired to loſe theſe Countries, inſtantly levied new Taxes, even the Tenths of all Goods and Eſtates, which ſo inraged the People that were already near ruined by the War, that upon the Privateers (who were ſent abroad by the Princes Commiſſion) taking the Town of Brill, a Port in Zealand, eight Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Holland, and all the Cities in Zealand except Middleburgh, declared for the Prince of Orange, and Fluſhing, a conſiderable City, being animated by the Prieſt at Maſs on Eaſter day in the Morning, turned out the Spaniſh Garriſons in ſuch fury that they hang'd Alvarez Kinſman to the Duke of Alva. And William Count of Bergen at the ſame time took ſeveral other Towns in Friezeland, and which moſt aſtoniſht Alva, Lewis of Naſſau, by the Aſſiſtance of the French, took Mons the chief City of Heynault.</p>
            <p>Mean while the Prince of Orange with an Army of 11000 Foot, and 6000 Horſe marches to Lovain, which preſented him with 16000 Crowns, and was received into Mechlin, and from thence comes within fight of Alva's Army, which was ſtrongly fortified, yet the Prince reſolved to force his Intrenchments, or oblige him to a Battel, which whilſt he was conſulting he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Advice of the horrid Maſſacre at Paris, whereby he loſt the Admiral Chaſtillon, and many other of his deareſt Friends, together with all hopes of any more Relief from France, ſo that not being able to oblige the Duke to a Battel, and doubting the French Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42023:8"/>manders who were his chief ſtrength ſhould deſert him upon News of the bloody Maſſacre, he writ to his Brother Lewis to make Terms for delivering up Mons then beſieged by Alva; and then with ſlow Marches retreated to the Rhyne, yet with ſome loſs and danger, for a Detatchment of Spaniſh Horſe and Foot, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Camp in the night, kill'd and burnt all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as far as his own Tent where he was faſt aſleep; but a little Dog which us'd to lie on his Bed, never left barking and ſcratching his face till he had waked him, ſo that leaping out of his Bed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the peril he was in, he haſtened to his Men, who were now coming to his Reſcue, and fell upon the Spaniards ſo furiouſly, that moſt of the Party, which were about a thouſand Horſe and Foot were cut off in their retreat.</p>
            <p>After which the Prince diſmiſſed his Army and came into Holland; theſe States with thoſe of Zealand having already acknowledged him for their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and taken an Oath to ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>But though the Prince had the full power of the Government in his own hands, yet he acted all matters in the name of the States, and by his extream dilligence in four months time he had provided a Fleet of 150 Sail well Rigged and Manned in the Port of Fluſhing; who for ten years after did unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage to the Spaniards, and were never but once worſted by them. He likewiſe baniſhed all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſuperſtitions out of the Churches, that difference in Religion might render them more irreconcileable to their old Adverſary.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of Alva having retaken Mons, ſent his Son to reduce ſome other Cities in Holland, and Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, and becauſe the Town of Haerlem had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received the Prince of Orange after the Duke had reduced it by Famine whereof near thirteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand died, he made a dreadful example of this place,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42023:8"/>the Spaniards firſt hanging the Governour, and for ſeveral days together hanging and drowning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Magiſtrates, and People of the City, to the number of near two thouſand, which butcheries made the Hollanders to be ſtill more reſolved and obſtinate againſt them; ſo that the other Towns made a more Vigorous defence, for fear of falling into the hands of ſuch cruel blood hounds. Soon after the Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va was recalled out of the Netherlands, and Lowis Requieſens of a milder temper was ſent to ſucceed him. King Philip now finding that Rigor and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did but inrage the Netherlanders, and made them more averſe to his Government: This new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had the fortune at his arrival to be an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of the deſeat of his Maſters Fleet, by that of the Prince of Orange; but yet was more fortunate by Land, for Prince Lowis of Naſſaw having brought a fourth Army out of Germany of ſeven thouſand Foot and four thouſand Horſe, was defeated by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards near Nimmeguen, the Germans according to their uſual cuſtom calling for their pay juſt as the battle began, and thereby were the ruine of themſelves, as well as of their Generals honour; Prince Lowis with his brother Prince Henry and the Count Palatine being all three killed in this fight. Upon which Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory the Spaniards beſieged Leyden, and reduced it to very great extremity, ſo that they were ready to Capitulate: But the Prince having an account of their condition, by Letters tyed to Pigeons and ſent into the Town: Reſolved to make the utmoſt effort poſſible to relieve it; and having provided two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Flat bottom Boates of fourteen or ſixteen Oars, and two Guns a piece, which he filled with Seamen and Proviſions, when all things were prepared the Hollanders broke down the Damm that kept out the Sea, which thereupon entred with ſuch fury into the Countrey, that it was overwhelmed with water, and and the Camp of the Spaniards was overflowed, ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42023:9"/>that the City received ſupplies forty mile off by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Spaniards having ſunk their Cannon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four months fruitleſs labour, were forced to raiſe the Seige, being purſued by the Dutch in their Boats with long grapling Irons, wherewith they drowned and deſtroyed a great number of their enemies. This deliverance from a Barbarous and Inhumane Enemy endeared the Prince of Orange to thoſe of Leyden, who to recompence their loſſes by the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, erected a Univerſity there, which he indowed with ample Revenues and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>But to recompence this loſs, Requeſones reduced Zurich-zee; but the Spaniards and Germans falling at variance, about their pay, and Requeſones dying at the ſame time, the unruly Souldiers fell upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriccht and Antwerp, both which Towns they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ranſackt of an immenſe Treaſure, rated at above Twenty Millions. The Robberies of thoſe Forreign Mutineers cauſed ſuch an abhorrence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the Government in the People, that thoſe which had hitherto continued obedient to the Spaniſh Government, now declared the Spaniards enemies to their King and Countrey, and called in the Prince of Orange to their aſſiſtance: All the Provinces, except Luxemburg entring into an Aſſociation, and Solemnly Swearing to aſſiſt each other in delivering their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from Spaniſh Slavery. This happened in 1576. when King Philip to remedy theſe diſorders ſent Don John of Auſtria, to be Governour of the Netherlands, who by his Mild and Affable behaviour wheedled the Provinces for a time to deſiſt from their gallant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though the Prince of Orange, who ſaw the bottom of the Spaniards deſigns, continually fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them not to be deluded with guilded promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet Don John having ſolemnly agreed That the States General ſhould aſſemble, and that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Germans ſhould depart out of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, ſeveral of the Provinces again ſubmitted to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42023:9"/>King Philip; the Prince of Orange with the States of Holland and Zealand proteſting againſt their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſpecially as to the Articles about Religion: But Don John was no ſooner ſetled in his Government, being received with much magnificence at Bruſſels, but he quickly made good the Princes Premonitions, for he ſeized upon Namur and Charlemont, and ſent for the Forreign Troops. Whereupon the States finding themſelves deluded, they reſolved to oppoſe him by Arms, and having demoliſhed the Caſtle of Antwerp, they joyned with the Prince of Orange, and ſent to deſire his preſence at Bruſſels, where he was received with all kinds of Joy, and the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People, and declared Governour of Brabant, and Super-Intendant of the Revenues of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>The States General having declared Don John of Auſtria the publick Enemy of their Countrey, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon recall'd the Italians and other Forreigners, who were baniſhed by the perpetual Edict, as it was called, and with them defeated the Army of the States at Gemblours, though this loſs was recompenſed by the ſurrender of the famous City of Amſterdam eight days after, which was then united to the Body of Holland.</p>
            <p>In the year 1579. the Prince of Orange laid the Foundation of the Republick of the Low-Countreys by the ſtrict Union he made between the Provinces of Gueldres, Zutphen, Holland, Zealand, Friezeland, and the Ommelands, conſiſting of 25 Articles, the chief whereof was,
<q>That theſe Provinces ſhould mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aſſiſt each other againſt the common Enemy, and not treat of War or Peace without general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</q> This was called, <hi>The Treaty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> becauſe ſigned in that City; and to ſhew that Union was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for their preſervation, the States took this for their Motto, <hi>Concordia parvae res creſcunt;</hi> By Concord little things grow great. But the Prince find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of theſe few Provinces not ſufficient to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42023:10"/>defend themſelves againſt the other Provinces that had reconciled themſelves to Spain, nor againſt that potent Crown he thought it adviſeable to chuſe ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince to be their Protector, and judged none more proper than the Duke of Anjou and Alenſon, the only Brother of Henry III. King of France, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners being ſent to him, it was ſoon agreed that theſe ſix Provinces of Holland, Zealand, Brabant, Flanders. Utrecht and Friezeland, ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for their Soveraign, upon condition,
<q>That he ſhould maintain them in their preſent Priviledges and Religion, that he ſhould aſſemble the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral once a year or oftner, if they thought fit, That he ſhould not diſpoſe of any Offices or Preferments without the conſent of the States. Laſtly, That if he ſhould endeavour to infringe or violate this Treaty, he ſhould immediately forfeit his Soveraignty, and they be fully abſolved from any Allegiance to him, and be at liberty to chuſe another Soveraign.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Agreement being made, Arch-Duke Matthias Brother to Rodolphus Emperor of Germany, who had been ſent for, ſome time before by ſome factious Lords, (who envied the Virtue and Glory of the Prince of Orange) finding that the States ſought for a more powerful Protector, took his leave and retired into Germany, though not without large Acknowledgment and Preſents from the States General. The Prince of Orange haſtened the March of the Duke of Alenſon, whoſe preſence he knew was very conſiderable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince in this year 1580, the King of Spain had publiſhed a moſt bloody Proſcription againſt him,
<q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him with the favours beſtowed on him by his Father Charles the V, and declaring him to be a Rebel, Heretick, Hypocrite, like to Cain and Judas, of an obdurate Conſcience, a Villain, the Head of the Netherland Troubles, a Plague to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and an Enemy to all Mankind; Declaring fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That he did proſecute and baniſh him out of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42023:10"/>his Countreys and Eſtates, forbidding any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to converſe with, or relieve him, giving all his Eſtate to thoſe that would take it, promiſing upon the word of a King, and as the Miniſter of Almighty God, That if any would deliver him alive or dead, or elſe take away his Life, he would give to him or his Heirs Five thouſand Crowns of Gold, and the free pardon of all the Crimes that he had been before guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and if they were not Noble, to make them ſo, and to reward all that ſhall aſſiſt them therein; and likewiſe that all his Adherents ſhould be baniſht, and their Lives and Eſtates given for a prey to any that would take them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of Orange made a very ſmart Apology in anſwer hereunto, wherein he fully vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all the Crimes objected againſt him, proving at large,
<q>That all the Miſeries of the Netherlands ought to be imputed to the Council of Spain, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reduce thoſe Countreys to abſolute Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, both as to Religion and Civil Liberties, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more like Mad-men than Politicians, and like that fooliſh King Rehoboam, following the ſilly Advice of a weak Woman, and Cardinal Granval the Pope's Creature telling the King, That his Father had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtized the People with Whips, but the Son ought to whip them with Scorpions, and therefore they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring in the Inquiſition, and the new Biſhops which were the occaſion of all theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And as to his taking Arms againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, he ſheweth, that Henry Baſtard of Caſtile, the King's great Grandfather, had with his own hands ſlain the King Don Pedro the Cruel, his lawful Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and poſſeſt his Kingdom, whoſe Succeſſor King Philip was, and enjoyed it to this day. And that there was a Reciprocal Bond between a Prince and a Subject, and if the Prince infringes his Oath, the Subject is freed from his Allegiance, that the King of Spain was admitted to be Duke of Brabant upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42023:11"/>certain conditions which he had ſworn to maintain, and yet had notoriouſly violated; and if the Nobility did not endeavour by Arms (ſince no other means was to be found) to preſerve and defend their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, they ought to be accounted guilty of Perjury, Treachery and Rebellion to the States of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And whereas the King had offered Money to take away his Life, he did not doubt of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, yet certainly he could never be accounted a Gentleman by Perſons of Honour, who would be ſo wicked and infamous to murder a Man for Money, except they were ſuch Spaniards, who being deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Mores and Jews, might retain that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from their Anceſtors who offered Money to Judas to betray our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt into their hands, that they might crucifie him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince concluded his Apology by telling the States General,
<q>That ſince their peace and quiet ſeemed to depend upon his death, he was willing to lay down his life to free them from the Calamities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they ſuffered, having already for their ſakes loſt his Eſtate, his Brethren, yea and his own Son, and that his Head, over which no Prince or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate on Earth had any power, was yet at their command, and that he would be a willing Sacrifice to procure their Tranquillity: But if they thought fit ſtill to uſe his Service, he would employ his Life, Counſel, and all he had in the World for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and preſervation of the Netherlands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this the States declare, That they are fully ſatisfied that the Crimes and Slanders charged upon the Prince are altogether falſe and malicious, and that all the Honours that had been conferred on him were ſo far from being ſought for or deſired by him, that he only accepted them at their earneſt requeſt and intreaty, with the full conſent, and by the free Election of the Countrey, and therefore they humbly intreated him ſtill to continue his Adminiſtration, and likewiſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42023:11"/>to accept of a Guard for his Perſon againſt any villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous attempts upon his Life.</p>
            <p>The States General of he United Provinces percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that notwithſtanding the Interceſſion both of the Emperor, the French King, the Queen of England, and other Princes and States of Chriſtendom to King Philip on their behalf, yet he ſtill continued obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to yield to nothing but what might reduce their Countrey abſolutely to Popery and Slavery, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in 1581. they publiſht an Edict of Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him, wherein they declare,
<q>That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledged by all Mankind that a Prince is ordained of God to preſerve his Subjects from all Injuries and Violence, even as a Shepherd defends his Sheep, and that the people were never created to be Bond-men and Slaves to his will and pleaſure whether his Commands are right or wrong, but that he is advanced to that dignity to govern them by equity and reaſon, and to cheriſh them as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his Children, even with the peril of his life. If a King therefore fail herein, and inſtead of protecting his Subjects, ſhall ſtrive to deſtroy them, and deprive them of their Ancient Laws and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and endeavour to make them Bond-ſlaves; His Subjects are thereupon diſcharged from all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience to ſuch a Soveraign, and are to reckon and eſteem him a Tyrant, and that he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely fallen from his former Dignity and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and the Eſtates of the Countrey may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and freely abandon him, and Elect another Prince to protect and defend them in his place, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when his Subjects neither by Prayers nor Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can mollifie his heart, nor divert him from his Tyrannical and Arbitrary courſes: Since they have then no other way to preſerve their Ancient Liberties, Lives, Wives, Children and Eſtates, which according to the Laws of God and Nature they are bound to defend, and which hath been practiſied in divers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42023:12"/>Countreys, eſpecially in thoſe where the King was obliged by Oath to govern according to Law, and was admitted to the Soveraignty upon certain conditions and ſpecial contracts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now it being apparent to all the World that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip King of Spain, giving ear to certain wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, hath in every particular broken all the Oaths and Obligations which he had entred into for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe Provinces, and hath determined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave, ruine and deſtroy them, and all their Intereſts therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We the States General being preſt by extream neceſſities, do by a general reſolution and conſent declare the King of Spain to be fallen from the Government, Dominion and Juriſdiction of theſe Countreys, and we are reſolved never hereafter to acknowledge him for our Prince and Soveraign Lord, but do hereby declare our ſelves and all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe Provinces, to be for ever diſcharged from all manner of Oaths, and Allegiance to the ſaid King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In witneſs whereof we have cauſed our our Seals to be hereunto annexed, <hi>July</hi> 26. 1581.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of Anjou having been in England to make a Viſit to Q. Elizabeth, returned again to Antwerp, after three months ſplendid Entertainment in the Engliſh Court, the Queen at his departure earneſtly recommending to him to govern the People with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to endeavour to gain their Affections, which would be the moſt durable Foundation that he could lay for the ſecurity of his Government. The Duke was received at Antwerp with all kind of Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, being made Duke of Brabant with much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and having taken an Oath to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them in all their Rights, afterward the Nobility and Gentry ſwore Allegiance to him as their Prince and Governour.</p>
            <p>Soon after a Plot was laid to kill the Prince of Orange, which was thus managed; Gaſpar de Anaſtro a Spaniſh Merchant living in Antwerp, finding his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42023:12"/>Affairs in a very low condition by reaſon of the many Debts he had contracted, and was not able to pay, he bethought himſelf of the great Reward promiſed by the King of Spain to the Murtherers of the Prince of Orange, and being greedy of this prey which he thought might again retrieve his credit, he conſulted with the Governour of Gravelin how to put this Fact in execution, and at length concluded to imploy a wicked Boy he had called Joanille to perpetrate it, who no ſooner was acquainted with it, but he readily undertook it. The day appointed for this execrable deed was on a Sunday, when the Duke of Anjou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great Feaſt, the Prince of Orange was preſent, the Boy accordingly came to the houſe, where he was confeſt by a Jacobin Fyrer, and promiſed the pardon of all his ſins, the Prieſt likewiſe deluding him, and ſaying, that he ſhould go inviſible, having given him ſome Characters in Papers with Frogs Bones and other Trifles that were found in his pocket. Being thus ſtrengthened in his Reſolution, he drank a Glaſs or two of Wine, and the Ghoſtly Father having given him his Bleſſing at the ſtairs foot, left him; Joanille comes into the Room where the Prince and ſeveral Lords were at Dinner, clad like a French-man, and was thought a Servant to one of the French Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he endeavoured to come near the Prince, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving charged his Piſtol with two Bullets, deſigning to ſhoot him behind as he had been inſtructed, but was ſtill hindered: The Prince having dined, went toward his Withdrawing Room, ſhewing by the way, to a Noble-man the Cruelties of the Spaniards in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, wrought in Tapeſtry, when the Murtherer having placed himſelf in a Window of the Hall, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his Piſtol againſt the hinder part of his head, but the Prince turning his face, at the ſame inſtant the Bullet entred in at the throat, it being ſo near that the fire entred with the wound, burning his Ruff and his Beard, and breaking one of his Teeth, the Bullet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42023:13"/>coming out at the left Cheek near his Noſe without hurting his Tongue: This terrible blow being given, all preſent were amazed, and one of the Halberdiers in a rage thruſt the Villain thorow, and a Page pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after diſpatcht him. The Boy was quickly known to belong to Anaſtro, who was impriſoned, together with the Monk, the firſt was releaſed, but the Fryer, together with the Carcaſs of the Murtherer were both hang'd, and after quartered. The Princes wound was ſomewhat dangerous, for the bleeding of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vein could by no art nor means be ſtopt, till they contrived, that for nine days together ſeveral perſons appointed ſhould hold their Thumbs upon the wound night and day, ſo that at length it cloſed, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was over. At firſt the French were thought to have committed the Fact, but the Prince of Orange, though weak, writing with his own hands to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of Antwerp to let them know it was a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, they at length were ſatisfied. The grief of that great City was extraordinary upon the Princes being wounded, the Magiſtrates commanding Faſts to be kept, to pray for his Recovery, and their Joy was as great when they heard he was out of danger. The Prince of Parma Governour of the Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, concluded him dead, and ſent mild Letters to ſeveral Cities to ſurrender to him.</p>
            <p>After this the Duke of Anjou envying the Power of the Prince of Orange, which he thought eclipſed his own, and not enduring to be a Soveraign only in name with ſuch a limited Authority, by the Advice of ſome of his young Councillors, he reſolved to ſeize upon the principal Places in the Netherlands, that is, Antwerp, Bruges, Dunkirk and Dendermond, upon pretence that the People of Antwerp had incompaſſed his Pallace with deſign to murther him. The two laſt he took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, but the Citizens of Bruges and Antwerp defended themſelves with ſo much courage, that the French were kill'd in ſuch heaps before the Gates as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42023:13"/>prevented thoſe without from enering in to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The Flemmings had ſome ſuſpitions, the Prince was concerned in the attempt; which was ſomewhat occaſioned by his fourth Marriage with Loviſe de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny a French Lady: But he perceiving it, and that the States party grew every day weaker in the Walloon Provinces, retired into Holland where he thought himſelf more ſecure, and his Life leſs expoſed to the Bigotted Papiſts; and ſetled at the City of Delph, where Henry Frederick Grandfather to our preſent Gracious Soveraign was born.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Anjous Party being defeated he was obliged to reſtore thoſe places of which he had made himſelf Maſter. And returning into France dyed ſoon after, ſome ſay of poyſon, others of meer vexation for this inglorious enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards thinking they had no greater Enemy in the World than the Prince of Orange; and that he being gone they ſhould attain their full purpoſes for inſlaving the Netherlands, they uſed all manner of baſe and treacherous practices to murder and deſtroy him, which they too ſucceſ-fully effected in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following. In May 1584. A Young man of above twenty ſeven coming to the Princes Court at Delph, delivered him a Letter as he paſſed along, the Prince demanding whence it came, the Youth being of a ſeeming innocent countenance replyed, that it was his own Letter, and contained matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the ſervice of the Countrey; It was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Francis Guyon. The Prince went away, and the next day the fellow deſiring a Councellor of the Princes that he might be heard and receive an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of his Letter, and that he had ſeveral other things of importance to diſcover both concerning the Countrey and Religion. The Prince having notice of it, commanded one of his Council to examine him; to whom he gave a large account of his pretended
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42023:14"/>adventures, and that he had procured ſeveral blanks (which he produced) with Count Mansfields Seal, which were given him for the uſe of Paſs-ports for Victualers, but might be ſerviceable to the Prince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occaſions. The Prince recovered the blank Paſs-ports, intending to try ſome experiment with them: And by this means he became ſo familiar at Court, that the Prince ſome days after having an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the death of the Duke of Anjou, he ſent for this Villain into his chamber to inquire ſomething of him while he was in bed, and the wretch afterwards confeſt in Priſon that if he had then had a Dagger or Penkniſe he would have certainly ſlain him then: After this he came conſtantly to Prayers and Sermons, and was obſerved to read Du Bartas Works, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Hiſtory of Judith and Holofernes, where there are certain perſuaſions and incouragements to cut off Tyrants; Sometimes he borrowed a Bible of the Porter upon pretence of Religion; ſo that at length he went about the Court without ſuſpition. A while after the Prince ordered him to be ſent to Count Biron into France, to try if he could make any advantage of the Paſs-ports, upon which he deſired money to buy Shoes and Stockings, being in an ill condition; The Prince ordered him ten or twelve Crowns. Next day he bought a Piſtol of one of the Guard, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it did not ſhoot true he bought two more which were according to his mind: After this he watched when the Prince went down to the Hall to Dinner, and demanded a Paſs-port of him, but in ſuch a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and contuſed Voice that the Princeſs askt what he was, for ſhe did not like his countenance; the Prince told ber his buſineſs: After Dinner the Prince going out of the Hall, the Villain ſtood behind a Pillar in the Gallery with his Cloak on one Shoulder, having two Piſtols under his left Arm, holding in his right hand a paper like a Paſs-port as it to have the Prince
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42023:14"/>ſign it; As the Prince paſſed along having one foot upon the firſt ſtep of the Stairs, the Traytor advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drew forth one of his piſtols ſo ſuddenly that he was not perceived till the blow was given; the three builets wherewith the piſtol was charged, entring in at his left ſide, and coming out on the right through the Stomach and Vital parts: The Prince feeling himſelf hurt ſaid only thus, <hi>O my God take pity of my Soul, I am ſore wounded: My God, take pity of my Soul and of this poor People.</hi> After which he began to ſtagger but his Gentleman Uſher ſupported him, and ſet him upon the Stairs, the Counteſs of Swartſenburg his Siſter asked him if he did not recommend his Soul to Jeſus Chriſt? he anſwered <hi>Yes,</hi> and never ſpake a word more, dying in a few minutes after: The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer endeavoured to eſcape, but being taken and told he was a wicked Traytor, to endeavour to kill the Prince; <hi>I am no Yraytor,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but have done what the King of</hi> Spain <hi>commanded me, and if I have not ſlain him curſed be my ill Fortune:</hi> After this he freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the whole matter, and that he had done it by the inſtigation of the Jeſuits, and the incouragement of the Prince of Parma who aſſured him of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed to the Aſſaſſinate by the King of Spain.</p>
            <p>For this horrid Crime a particular and tremendous ſentence was pronounced againſt him by the Judges
<q>That Baltazar Gerrard (which he confeſt was his true name) ſhould be la'id upon a Scaffold in the Market place of Delft, to have his right hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he committed that execrable deed, torn with two burning hot pincers, and the like to be done in ſix ſeveral parts of his Body, as his Arms, Thight and ſeveral other Fleſhly parts; his privy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to be cut off, and he to be Quartered alive to have his Heart plackt our and thrown in his Face, and laſtly his Head to be cut off, and to be ſet upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42023:15"/>a Pole upon the watch Tower behind the Princes lodgings; His four Quarters to be hanged upon Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets upon the four Bulwarks of the Town.</q> This Sentence, ſaid the Judges, we think fit to pronounce againſt this wicked Murtherer, for having (to the great grief and ſorrow of all good men) committed a moſt execrable Crime, and abominable Treaſon, upon the Perſon of ſo Famous and Renown'd a Prince as the Prince of Orange was; for which he ought in no wiſe to remain unpuniſhed, but rather with all rigor and ſeverity to be made an Example to future Ages.</p>
            <p>Having notice of his Death he was at firſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, curſing the hour of his birth, and wiſhing he had never learned the wicked Principles of the Jeſuits at Dole, but had been ſtill a mean Tradeſman, and not fallen into this folly; But ſince it is done, ſaid he, there is no remedy, and I muſt now ſuffer for it. This dreadful Sentence was fully executed, and yet in all his torments he never cryed out, nor ſeemed to be in any pain; Yea ſmiled at an accident that happened in the midſt of his Tortures. Having often boaſted that he would not ſhew the leaſt ſign of fear,</p>
            <p>Thus died the renowned William Prince of Orange at fifty one Years of Age. He was of an active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and a ſtrong memory; and his Wiſdom, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Magnanimity, his Courage, Patience, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were all ſo extraordinary, that they are rather to be admired than deſcribed. A Perſon in whom concurred a ſolid Judgment to undertake ſo great and difficult an Enterprize, and an unparallelled Courage to carry it on; and a very great Conſtancy to finiſh the Freedom of his Countrey againſt the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Spain, and the Treacheries of many of his own Countreymen. So that the States and People of the Netherlands who had ſo often experienced his Conduct and Magnanimity in their moſt preſſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42023:15"/>admired his Virtues which ſcarce ever m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was carried from thence into Spain at 13 Years of Age, and educated in the Roman Catholick Religion, where he continued a Priſoner above 30 Years; during which, his Jailor preſuming to ſpeak abuſively of the Proceedings of his Father, the Prince who inherited his gallant temper, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during his inſolent diſcourſe, took him about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and throwing him out of the Window broke his Neck; The K. of Spain conſulted with his Council what Puniſhment to inflict for this great Action; but at length, by the interpoſing of a generous young Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard who was preſent, and affirmed that the Captain's ill carriage was the occaſion of his Death, it was paſſed over.</p>
               <p>But at length, in hope to create ſome Jealouſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Brother Maurice and himſelf, K. Philip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him and ſent him into Flanders, where he lived

               <p>The next Year the Prince took Groning, the Capital City of that province; alſo Rhineburg, Meurs, and Grave, and gained great Reputation by the defence of Oſtend; for the Spaniards having made themſelves Maſters of it, after a Siege of three Years, with the loſs of Sixty thouſand Men, and the expence of above a Hundred Millions of Treaſure, they were poſſeſſed of nothing but a heap of Ruins, more like a Burying place than a City; And the Prince ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gained Sluce, a place of far greater Importance.

               <p>But King Lewis his inveterate Enemy, did acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally very much contribute to his Exaltation, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in 1672. like a rapid Torrent over-run the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Batavian Republick, he thereby gave opportunity to the Prince to diſcover to the World, the Spirit of his Anceſtors, in recovering the United Provinces from the ruine which ſeemed to attend them by the ſucceſs of that King, even beyond his hopes, nay almoſt his wiſhes, which put that People into ſuch a conſternation as occaſioned them to complain of the unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Cornelius and John De Wit, who had then the ſole management of all affairs, and to believe that none but the glorious Houſe of Naſſaw was capable to ſupport their tottering State in this Age againſt their Potent French Enemies, as they had formerly reſcued them from the Tyranny of Spain.</p>
               <p>Neither was the Grandmother of the Prince want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage the favourers of that Family to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remove that Eclipſe under which it had ſo long ſuſtered, which Her Highneſs managed with a courage and magnanimity above her Sex, ſo that being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by Her Remonſtrances, they began to conſider how they themſelves had of late been ſlighted and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42023:19"/>whilſt all the great Imployments of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth were beſtowed upon the Sons of Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, and being ſeconded by the rage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, who were dreadfully terrified to ſee a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Army in the very bowels of their Countrey, they obliged the States General in the beginning of 1672. to depute Monſieur Beverning, John De Wit, and Jaſper Fagel to inveſt His Highneſs the Prince of Orange in the Dignities belonging to his Anceſtors, of Captain and Admiral General of the United Provinces, who having accepted the ſame, and taken his Oath, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went upon action againſt the French: But the Province of Holland ſtill ſuſpected the fidelity of their Magiſtrates, ſeeing their Frontier Towns and Garriſons fall daily into the hands of their Victorious Enemies, and at Dort they raiſed a dangerous Mutiny, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that His Highneſs ſhould be advanced to the Stadt-Holderſhip alſo, as judging it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the publick good: Upon which an Act was inſtantly drawn up, and read in the publick Hall by the Secretary, wherein the Magiſtrates declared His Highneſs the Prince of Orange Stadtholder, Captain and Admiral General of all their Forces by Sea and Land, with the ſame Power and Authority that His Anceſtors of glorious Memory had formerly enjoyed; which occaſioned great rejoycing in that City.</p>
               <p>But Cornelius De Witt, an Antient Burgomaſter of the Town, returning at the ſame time indiſpoſed from the Fleet, and being deſired to ſign the ſaid Act, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>He would never do it,</hi> nor could all the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Friends, nor the menaces of the multitude, who were ready to break into his houſe, nor the tears of his Wife, who was ſenſible of his danger, prevail upon his obſtinate temper, till ſhe threatned to ſhew her ſelf to the People, and declare her own and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Innocency, and abandon him to the fury of the ungoverned Populace; which ſoon after occaſioned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42023:20"/>his Tragical Death, for they being fully perſwaded that he and his Brother John were real Enemies to the Prince, and a certain Surgeon having charged Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius that he had made a private Propoſal to him to take away His Highneſs Life, he was thereupon impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and upon Trial was ſentenced to forfeit all his Dignities and Imployments, and to be for ever baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Territories of Holland and Weſtfrieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>The People who accounted the Prince to be their Protector and Deliverer, believed his Judges to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in puniſhing ſo great a Crime with ſo eaſie a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Trained Bands at the Hague being in Arms, they preſently ran to the Priſon, where while they were got together, it happened that John de Witt came in his Coach to fetch his Brother out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Upon which one of the Burgeſſes cryed out,
<q>Now the two Traitors are got together, and it is our fault if they eſcape us.</q> This had been enough to inflame the multitude, but a greater motive happened; for while they were all expecting the coming down of the two De Witts, an unhappy report was raiſed, that above a thouſand Peaſants and Fiſhermen were upon their March to plunder the Hague, upon which another Burger cryed out,
<q>Come Gentlemen, let us pull theſe Traytors out by the Ears, do but follow me and I will lead the way.</q> Theſe words, with their great affection to the Prince, and the ruin of their Countrey, to both which they accounted the De Witts to be the greateſt Enemies compleated their Rage, ſo that they Immediately broke open the Priſon doors, and ſorced down the two Brothers into the Street, where they were ſoon diſpatcht by the multitude, who after they had laid the Penſionary John De Witt ſprawling on the ground, cryed out, <hi>See there the Traytor that has betrayed his Countrey.</hi> Thus fell John and Cornelius de Witt, two violent Enemies to the Houſe of Orange. It is ſaid,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42023:20"/>that John was the Contriver of thoſe Acts whereby His Highneſs was ſecluded from all the Great Imployments which were due to him from his Predeceſſors, and that a certain Ambaſſador being in private diſcourſe with him, ſaid,
<q>Moſt Illuſtrious Sir, I have heard much of your ſingular prudence, and unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but far leſs than what I now obſerve, from whence I dare aſſuredly pronounce, that either you will be the ruin of the Prince, or elſe that one day for his ſake you will come to deſtruction.</q> It is likewiſe reported, that when he was a Youth of about eighteen years old, a certain Advocate being deſired by his Father to examine him, gave this account of him;
<q>That he found in him thoſe great Parts and that ripeneſs of Wit, which was rarely to be ſeen in others:</q> And afterwards when he was made Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Holland and Dort the ſame Advocate preſaged of him,
<q>That he would never die a natural death.</q> 
                  <q>Thus (ſaith a worthy Perſon) ended one of the greateſt Lives of any Subject of our Times in the 47th year of his Age, after having adminiſtred in that State as Penſioner of Holland for about eighteen years with great Honour to his Countrey and himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be remarked that the preſent War with the States General was commenced in concert between the French King and Charles II. in a time of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt peace and ſecurity on the Dutch ſide, ſo that when the Engliſh fell upon their Smyrna Fleet, no clap of Thunder in a Froſty morning could be more ſurprizing, both to the Hollanders, and the reſt of Chriſtendom; Yea the Court of France it ſelf could ſcarce believe that we would run ſo great an Adventure, though our Court had obliged themſelves thereto; And though in the Declaration of War which the King publiſhed, the Dutch are charged with making abuſive Pictures and denying the right of the Flag, which was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prerogative of the Crown of England, yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42023:21"/>the Parliament and People were of opinion that this War was made in purſuance of the Inſtructions of the French King, ſent over to Dover by the Dutcheſs of Orleance; whereby the deſtruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of Holland is declared to be the only means to ſettle Arbitrary Government and Popery in theſe three Nations.</p>
               <p>Upon our Declaration of War, the French King began to march with his Vaſt Army into the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands which he over-ran with ſuch a rapid motion that the People were aſtoniſhed, and the States knew not what courſe to take to prevent it, which occaſioned thoſe Commotions aforementioned; But his Highneſs the Prince of Orange being advanced to the Stadthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, the face of affairs began to alter, and their Courage was revived: Monſieur Fagel ſucceeded De Wit as Penſioner, and the Prince preſently reſolved to be upon action, rejecting all the applications made to him by the two Kings, of making him Soveraign of the Provinces with ſuch diſdain and greatneſs of Soul as is ſcarce to be matcht, always declaring,
<q>That he would never betray a Truſt that was given him, nor ever ſell the Liberties of his Countrey that his Anceſtors had ſo long defended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In purſuance of this generous Reſolution his Highneſs took the Command of the Army upon him, who were more animated at the thoughts of being under the Conduct of ſo gallant a General. So that at Bodegrave an handfull of men twice repulſed above five thouſand of the French from the Walls of Ardenburg, and beſides the ſlain took five hundred Priſoners with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commanders, and Perſons of Quality, through the extraordinary valour of no more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Burgers and one hundred Garriſon Souldiers only that they were affiſted by the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Women filling the Bandilcers, and the Children brought Bullets to their Parents.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42023:21"/>
               <p>Soon after the Seige of Groningen which had been beſeigned with near three thouſand men by the Biſhop of Munſter; was by the Courage of the Citizens raiſed with the loſs of half the Enemies Army, and a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantity of Ammunition ſpent in vain in reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, to which his Highneſs care in furniſhing them with all neceſſaries for deſence was highly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Prince reſolving to diſlodge the Outguards of the French, gave a ſtrong Alarm to them, and without moving from his Saddle all night, drove them to their Trenches before Utrecht, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied ſeveral Lords Priſoners to Amſterdam. His Highneſs then reſolved to attempt the reducing of Woerden, and after a bloody and obſtinate Fight wherein above two thouſand of the French were ſlain and not above ſeven hundred of the Dutch. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs finding the Gariſon relieved with ſuch a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſupply, drew off his men and retreated to his Quarters. After which was held a Council of War of the Principal Officers of the Army, which being ended a certain Colonel would needs be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently inquiſitive of the Prince to know what was his great deſign againſt the French at that time; His Highneſs demanded of him, whether he would diſcover to any other what he ſhould declare to him; The Colonel ſaid, No, he would not; <hi>Then</hi> ſaid the Prince, <hi>my Tongue is alſo endued from Heaven with the ſame Grace,</hi> An anſwer becoming the wiſdom of a Prince and the reſervedneſs of a Great Commander.</p>
               <p>His Highneſs being with the Army at Maſtricht, ſent out a Party to reduce the ſtrong Caſtle of Valche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren which was ſoon ſurrendred with a great quantity of Wheat and other Proviſions. During this time the Dake of Luxemburg with fourteen thouſand Horſe and Foot reſolved to Invade the Province of Holland, in hope to plunder Leyden and the Hague, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42023:22"/>marcht from Woerden over the Ice with 3500 of the lighteſt of the Infantry of whith attempt his Highneſs having notice marched with all ſpeed toward the French, who in the mean time had taken Swamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and by the retiring of Colonel Paine Vin from his Poſt at Niewerbrong had a free paſſage open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their retreat, who muſt alſo have periſhed in the waters, or ſurrendred by reaſon of the ſudden thaw; The Duke himſelf was like to have been loſt by a fall into the thawed water, loſing in this ſhippery expedition above ſix hundred of his beſt Souldiers The French committed horrid ravages at Swammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; Raviſhing Women, Stripping and Wounding the Aged and Decrepit, and throwing infants that ſmiled in their Faces into the fire</p>
               <p>And now the ſtrong City of Coverden the Key of the Provinces of Frizeland and Groning, which in that fatal year 1672. fell into the hands of the Biſhop of Munſter with great loſs of men and a long Seige, was retaken in an hour and not above ſixty men ſlain, and of the Enemy a hundred and fifty killed and 430 Priſoners; It was furniſhed by the Biſhop with a predigious quantity of warlike Ammubition. This ſucceſs highly incouraged the Dutch, and ſo furprized the Enemy that they inſtantly quitred ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Garriſons, and much advanced the Honour of the Prince, to whoſe prudent mannagement of affairs they attributed this happy alteration in the Fortune of their Countrey; Which his Highneſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe extended to pacifie the Diſſentions between the Old and New Magiſtrates of Frizeland who acted contrary to each other, but upon his Highneſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Aſſembly, all diſcords vaniſht, and all things were ſetled for the defence of the Netherlands by his viſiting the Frontier Fortifications of Fluſhing, Sluce, Ardenburg, (where the Keys of the Town were delivered him in a Silver Baſon by the Young
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42023:22"/>Virgins of that City, deck'd with Garlands of ſeveral Flowers) and ſeveral other ſtrong places.</p>
               <p>In 1673. the Dutch were hetly aſſailed, on the one ſide by the French King with a puiſſant Army, while Conde and Luxemburg lay at Utrecht with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Forces to watch an opportunity to invade the very Centre of their Territories, and by Sea the King of England vigorouſly attackt them with his own and the French Fleet, ſo that the Prince of Orange was obliged not to ſtir abroad but to obſerve their deſigns, and prevent the threatned Deſcent of the Engliſh. In May the King of France with an Army of 42000 men ſate down before Maſtricht, the Garriſon conſiſted of about 4000 Foot, and 900 Horſe under Monſieur Farieux a reſolute and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, as appeared by the ſtout reſiſtance he made againſt this mighty Force, ſo that though the French gained the place, yet it was with ſuch a deluge of Blood, no leſs than 9000 of their braveſt Souldiers being Slain in the Seige with an incredible number of his choiceſt Officers, that the purchaſe was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dear; And after three weeks valiant defence, with the loſs of half the Garriſon by innumerable eſſaults, Batteries and Storming of freſh Aſſailants night and day; The Couragious Governour would ſtill have held it out, had not the Petitions of the Magiſtrates and Eccleſiaſticks obliged him to ſurrender, of whoſe worthy conduct the Prince of Orange was ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that he inſtantly preferred him to be Major General of the Army. And the French King was ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified that when he had taken the Town he broke up his Army, and returned to Paris, ſending part of them to Turrenne, to inable him to harraſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Treves, becauſe that Elector had aſſiſted the Emperor againſt him.</p>
               <p>The French Army being thus diſperſt, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Fleet ſince the Ingagement of May 28. (wherein
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42023:23"/>both ſides claimed the Victory) being retired from the Coaſt of Holland, His Highneſs now more at liberty, reſolved not to lie ſtill, ſo that calling off his Forces which lay for the defence of Zealand to joyn with the reſt of the Army, he ſate down before Naerden with 20000 Men, upon which the Duke of Luxemburg with 10000, and four Reigments of Munſter Horſe, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced within view of the Princes Intrenchments, but not daring to attempt the Relief of the Town, the Prince after three hours reſiſtance beat the French from their Works, and forced them to retire in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſion into the City, and the next day they furtendred it up. The Garriſon marching out, the Governour made a profound Reverence to the Prince, and it is ſaid aſſured him.
<q>That he had Reaſons ſufficient to ſurrender the Town ſo ſoon:</q> But it ſeems the King did not think them ſo, for he was condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment, and had his Sword broken over his head at Utrecht: For the Garriſon conſiſted in near Three thouſand Men and wanted neither Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition nor Proviſions, and the French had much ſtrengthned the Fortifications, yet the Prince took it in four days, and loſt not above a hundred Men, and two hundred wounded.</p>
               <p>And now His Highneſs to avoid ſo many Sieges as the Towns they had loſt would coſt to recover, reſolved upon a gallant Action, the boldneſs of which amazed all Men, but the ſucceſs extolked the prudence as well as the bravery of it. For the King of Spain and the Emperor having joyned in a Confederacy with the States General for mutual defence againſt the French as the common Enemy of both; The Prince, that he might perform ſomething remarkable before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Winter, marched directly with his Army out of the Netherlands, and joyning with the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, he reſolved to beſiege Bonne, which had been put into the hands of the French the beginning
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42023:23"/>of the War, wherein the Elector of Cologne, and the Biſhop of Munſter had entred joyntly with France: It had a Garriſon of Two thouſand Men and was well furniſht with all proviſions; and Eighty great Guns mounted on their Walls and Bulwarks. The Marſhal D'Humieres, with Seven thouſand Horſe, faced the Leaguer, but durſt not venture to ſuccour it, ſo that the Confederates having finiſht their Batteries, and brought three Mines to perfection, prepared for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Storm, but willing to ſave their Men, ſent a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Governour to ſurrender the Town, ſince they were without Relief, and if they pleaſed might ſend out ſome to ſee what Mines were ready to play upon their refuſal, which would be followed by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Sword all in Arms if taken by Storm. This ſo affrighted them, that the next day they capitulated, and 1500 French marched out of the Town, the reſt being either dead or wounded.</p>
               <p>This ſucceſsful Expedition of His Highneſs put the French into ſuch a Conſternation to ſee the reverſe of their Fortune, that they who lately with inſulting Pride threatned the ruin of others, were now at their wits end to ſave themſelves; ſo that upon the loſs of ſo many Men as had lately died by Sickneſs and the Sword, they were compell'd to abandon all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in the Netherlands in leſs time than they gained them, retaining only Maſtricht and the Grave of all they lately poſſeſt belonging to this Republick. Woer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den was the firſt that felt their Tyranny, and was firſt evacuated, but the Duke of Luxemburg extorted 16000 Livers of them, to ſave the Town from burning, by the King's Order. Harderwick paid 12000 Livers; Creveceur 3000 Piſtols; Bommel a ſtrong Fortreſs on which the King of France had beſtowed 60000 Livers, gave Hoſtages to pay 36000 Livers to ſpare their Houſes. Utrecht was obliged to give an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns; and the French all departing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42023:24"/>in one day, the Burgomaſters abſolved each other from their Oaths which they had taken againſt the Reſtoration of His Highneſs the Prince of Orange, to whom they ſent their Deputies to acknowledge him their Stadtholder in the name of the whole Province of Utrecht. Thus His Highneſs may in ſome ſenſe ſeem to have out-done Caeſar himſelf, for he vanquiſht even where he neither ſaw nor came, but only by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his Arms and Victories. In conſideration of this happy Turn of Affairs occaſioned by the prudence and conduct of His Highneſs, the States General in February following publiſhed a Decree to declare their Gratitude, confirming the charge of Stad tholder of the Province of Holland and Weſt-Friezeland on the Perſon of His Highneſs during Life, and alſo on the Heirs Males of his Body, as a ſtanding Monument of his ſurpaſſing Merits. And that very day the States of Zealand likewiſe conferred the ſame Dignities upon His Highneſs, and made him withall Hereditary Noble of their Province.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1674. the Parliament and People of England being weary of the War with Holland, which was entred into without their conſent or liking, were very deſirous of a Peace; ſo that the French-Court-party having little hope of wheedling the Houſe of Commons to give any more Money to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their black deſigns againſt the Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Nation under the pretence of this War, they were obliged to make a ſeparate Peace with the Dutch excluſive of the French King, though to their great regret, that they were forced to abandon their dear Ally, from whom they had drawn ſuch great ſums of Money for ſecret ſervice upon the ſtrength and heart of this Peace, His Highneſs the Prince of Orange concerted with the German and Spaniſh Troops to begin an Offenſive War, and in the head of an Army of 40000 Men to march into France: In
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42023:24"/>purſuance hereof the three Armies being joyned, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Nivelle the beginning of Auguſt 1674. where they continued for ſome days, but finding the Prince of Conde who lay not far off encamped with an Army of Fifty thouſand, unwilling to come forth and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Battel in the open Field, they endeavoured by all ways imaginable to provoke and draw him out of his Trenches, but all proving ineffectual, they reſolved to beſiege ſome place of importance, believing that Conde would endeavour to relieve it: Whereupon His Highneſs marched from Seneffe toward Brinch, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Souches with the Imperial Forces leading the Van: Count Waldeck commanded the main Battel with the Holland Army, and Count de Monterey the Reer with the Spaniards, the Prince of Orange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the whole Confederate Army.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Conde having notice of their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being ſenſible of the difficulty and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the paſſages, put his Men in order, and letting the Van-Guard paſs, and the greateſt part of the main Body ſome Leagues before, he then fell in upon the Rere-Guard of the Spaniſh Horſe and Dragoons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifting of Four thouſand, commanded by the Prince de Vaudemont, and broke them with great flaughter, and not much reſiſtance, taking ſeveral Priſoners of Quality, with the Baggage, which the Prince of Orange having notice of, he ſent three Battalions of Infantry to their Relief. Conde warmed with ſucceſs, drew his whole Army out of their Trenches, and fell with much fury upon the Dutch Squadron, breaking them to pieces, killing or taking all their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and gaining ſeveral Standards: And here His Highneſs the Prince of Orange gave particular Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his undaunted Bravery, throwing himſelf with his Sword in his hand before the daunted Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, endeavouring by all means imaginable to ſtop their flight, and by his own example encouraged them

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42023:27"/>to renew the Battel, ſo that he was often in danger either of being ſlain or taken Priſoner? But at length His Highneſs joyning the reſt of the Dutch who ſtood firm, whom he made the Right Wing, with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts and Spaniards in the Left, the Fight was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with more fury and vigour than ever, both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being animated with hope of Victory, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally reſolved rather to die than be overcome. His Highneſs omitted no pains upon this important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; ſo animating his Souldiers, that they ſtrove with emulation to outdo one another, and both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fought till night with an obſtinacy on both ſides hardly to be parallel'd, though the Fields were all ſtrown over with the Bodies of the ſlain and wounded, while the Combatants covered with Blood and Sweat, encouraged each other the more by that diſmal ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle. Thus the fury of the French, which at firſt carried all before them, about Ten a Clock at night began to abate, the French Infantry, of which they had loſt a conſiderable part, drawing off at a diſtance, notwithſtanding all the endeavours of the Prince of Conde to have brought them back again, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fearing ſome farther miſchief might befall his Army, ordered the Horſe alſo to retire, leaving the Victory by this means to His Highneſs the Prince of Orange, who two hours after the Retreat of the French, drew off his Army likewiſe to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Quarters.</p>
               <p>Thus ended this bloody Battle, wherein at firſt the French prevailed but at length loſt the Victory, having 7000 men ſlain outright, beſides the wounded, of whom the P. of Conde left above 1500 in the Villages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Quarters at Pieton; On the Confederates ſide the Slain, Wounded, and Deſerters, amounted to about 6500 in all. It was ſaid that a Letter was intercepted from the Prince of Conde to the French King, giving him an account,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42023:27"/>review of his Army he found himſelf but in an ill condition, having loſt the flower of his Infantry, and the beſt part of his Horſe; and therefore did not think himſelf ſtrong enough to venture a ſecond Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</q> Having likewiſe loſt a great number of Officers and Perſons of Quality; and ſeveral Standards, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which was one called, the White Standard of France, (which was afterward hung up with great ſolemnity in the Church of the Carmelites at Bruſſels) richly imbroidered with Gold and Silver with a Sun in the middle paſſing through the Zodiack, with this Haughty Motto, <hi>Nilobſtabit Eunti;</hi> Nothing can ſtop his Courſe. But the principal honour of this Victory ought, next under God, to be aſcribed to his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, of whom General Souches gives the following account in a Letter to the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have endeavoured to diſcharge my Duty in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, during the Bloody and Famous Battle between the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army and that of the Chriſtian King, the happy Iſſue of which has proved ſo much to the Glory of the Prince of Orange, who ſhewed upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the prudence of an Aged Captain, the Courage of a Caeſar, and the Undaunted Bravery of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, all which my Lords I ſpeak without flattery, as being contrary to my Nature.</q> And as the Friends ſo the Enemies of his Highneſs agreed to give him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Glory for this Adventure, the Prince of Conde himſelf declaring,
<q>That he had done in all things like an old Captain, but only in venturing himſelf too much like a Young man;</q> Though this old Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had done the ſame in this days action, charging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thickeſt Troops like a Young Cavaleer.</p>
               <p>The next day after the fight his Highneſs marched with his whole Army near Mons, and took up his head Quarters at St. Gilaine till they had recovered their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42023:28"/>diſorders in the late battel, and then began to think of further action; At length it was concluded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeige Oudenard, to draw the Prince of Conde out of his cautious marches to relieve it; The Confederates made their approches to the Town, and were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Maſters of the Counterſcarp, when Conde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped from Beumont with his whole Army of Forty thouſand men either to relieve or give the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Battel; His Highneſs adviſed that they ſhould immediately fall upon the enemy weary and tired with a long March, but General Souches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the execution of this magnanimous reſolution, for inſtead of ranging his men in Battalia, he croſt the River in ſo much haſte that he left ſome Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non behind him, and thereby left a way open for the Prince of Conde to enter the Town with part of his Army, who thinking he had done enough in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it avoided coming to a Battle. So that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs finding no more good to be done, reſolved to march back to Grave, where his preſence would be more neceſſary, leaving Count Waldeck the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army in his Abſence. The Seige of this place had been undertaken ſometime before by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rabenhaupt, the Garriſon conſiſted of 4000 Foot and 900 Horſe, of which the Marques of Chamilly a valiant and expert Captain was Governour, wherein were 450 pieces of Cannon, of which 100 were mounted upon the Bulwarks, beſides a vaſt quantity of Powder, Corn, Granadoes, and all manner of Warlike Ammunition, for the French had made a Magazine there of all that they had brought away from their deſerted Conqueſts. Rabenhaupt ſate down before it with about twenty Regiments of Foot and ſome Horſe, and was after reinforced by the Troops of the Prince of Courland and the Elector of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, who Summoned the City on every ſide, aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with much violence, but was as vigorouſly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42023:28"/>defended by thoſe within, though they were reduced to drink water; His Highneſs arrived there, Oct. 9. with 60 Cornets of Horſe whoſe preſence revived the Courage of the Beſiegers; Yet the French held out till the twenty fifth, when Chamilly finding ſuch large breaches made in the Fortifications, much widened by the fortunate blowing up of a Mine which almoſt deſtroyed a Covert way, ſo that it was impoſſible for him to hold out againſt the general Storm deſigned the next day, he ſurrendred the Town upon Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Articles.</p>
               <p>The following Winter was ſpent in preparing for an early Campagne, the next year 1675, in the beginning whereof the Hollanders made grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to His Highneſs the Prince of Orange for his ſignal conduct and Services in redeeming them from the Calamities which they had ſuffered under a Cruel Forreign Enemy, offering him the Title of Duke of Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, but to convince the World of the ſincerity of his intentions, and how little ambitious he was to agg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize himſelf by the War, His Highneſs refuſed thoſe Honours, but being at the ſame time offered the command of Governour Hereditary of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince he readily accepted it, and in the management thereof diſcovered his excellent prudence in Civil as well as Military Affairs.</p>
               <p>But whilſt His Highneſs was intent to oppoſe the deſigns of the French for the ruin of his Countrey, he was viſited with the Small Pox, which ſtruck a great damp to the proggreſs of Affairs, and was the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as having proved ſatal to his Family in the Perſons of his Father, Mother, and his Uncle the D. of Gloceſter, but it pleaſed God that by the care and skill of an able Phyſitian, and certain peculiar Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſent him by the Duke of Brandenburg his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs recovered, and within 20 days was abroad again, and haſtned to the General Rendeſvouze of his Army
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42023:29"/>at Roſendael, in order to the relief of Limburg then beſieged by the Marqueſs of Rochefort, the King of France with an Army under the Prince of Conde poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf advantagiouſly for covering the Siege; But ſuch was the ſlowneſs of the Germans, and the weakneſs and diſorder of the Spaniſh Troops that the Beſieged having little hopes of relief and unable to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the great numbers of the French Troops ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſooner than was expected. After which having waſted a great part of the adjoining Countrey the King returned to Paris, being prevented from doing farther miſchief by the diligence of his Highneſs, and the D. de Villa Hermoſa.</p>
               <p>Soon after the great General Tureine being kill'd by a Cannon Bullet in Alſatia, the Prince of Conde was ſent thither as General, and the Count de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency was left to command the French Army, who though a Captain no leſs wary than his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, yet his Highneſs kept him ſo upon his guard that he could not diſturb the Siege of Treves, which after the fatal overthrow of Monſieur Crequi fell into the hands of the Imperialiſts; So that Montmorency was unwilling to hazard a Battel with the Prince after two ſuch great loſſes, for fear of a third, inſomuch that he ſuffered Binch to ſurrender to his Highneſs at diſcretion, it being a Garriſon of 350 men, and had great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Proviſions, even in the ſight of his Army; But it appeared afterward the Count had poſitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to engage the Confederates, ſo that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs finding Winter approaching broke up his Army and returned to the Hague.</p>
               <p>The King of France at this time ſeemed very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Peace, his Subjects being wearied and ruined with the charge of the War, and ſeveral Princes offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to interpoſe in the matter, and the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land continuing ſtill in the French Intereſts, ſeemed very zealous therein, and took upon him to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42023:29"/>between that King and his Enemies; At length in 1676 a Treaty was begun at Nimegen, whither the Pleinpotentiaries from all parts repaired as to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendeſvouz; But the preparations for War went on as vigorouſly as ever, and his Highneſs was throughly imployed to get his Army ready early in the Spring, conſidering the formidable Muſters the French made under Marſhal Crequi, near Charleville, and Marſhal d' Humieres having got together a Body of 15000 Men, fell into the Country of Aloſt, and the Spaniards being too weak to reſiſt him, put all the Countrey under Contribution. Hereupon His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs marched with all ſpeed to join the D. of Villa Hermoſa at Cambron, which he did April. 26. But before this Marſhal Crequi had ſurrounded the City of Conde with 16000 men, and the K. of France and D. of Orleans upon notice thereof joined him with 10000 more, who inceſſantly batter'd the Town four days together with much fury, inſomuch that they were forced to ſurrender at Diſcretion, though his Highneſs was marched as far as Granville for their Relief. After this the King of France ſent the D. of Orleans to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege Bouchain with ſome of his Troops, it being a ſtrong Fortreſs of conſiderable conſequence, the K. poſting his Army ſo as to hinder the Prince from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, but his Highneſs ſtrugling through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Seaſon, and want of Proviſions and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines in Flanders marched with his Army in view of the French King, facing him ſeveral days together, and at length was reſolved to have attackt him with a Detachment of 12000 Men, and to endeavour to have relieved the Town, but underſtanding the place was taken, he altered his reſolution; Nor would his Highneſs ſtir till the French K. firſt decamped, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prince the honour of having dared the whole Power and Fortune of France, ſo that if the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42023:30"/>loſt a ſmall Town, the French loſt the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of accepting ſo brave a challenge.</p>
               <p>The K. of France returning home and leaving his Army under the Command of Marſhal Schomberg; His Highneſs concluded with the Spaniards and the German Princes of the Lower Rhyne, to ſet down before Maſtricht, which though ſtrong before, yet had been extreamly Fortified ſince poſſeſt by the French, and had now a Garriſon of 8000 choice men under Calvo a reſolute Catalonian; To divert this Siege Schomberg ſends the Marſhal de Humieres with 15000 men to beſiege Aire a City in the Province of Artois, and ſtrongly incompaſt on three ſides by a Marſh, the only way to approach it being defended by a ſtrong Fort, with five Baſtions and a Mote, but the Fort not having men ſufficient to defend it againſt the great numbers of the French, who likewiſe threw Bombs inceſſantly into the Town, and fired the Houſes, the Townſmen grew ſo impatient that they beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and the Articles were ſoon agreed by the French, becauſe they heard the D. of Villa Hermoſa was coming to relieve it, and the Governour was forced to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Town.</p>
               <p>His Highneſs continued the Siege of Maſtricht all this while with much vigor, and the latter end of July the Trenches were opened, his Highneſs aſſigning to every one their Quarters; and among the reſt the Engliſh under three Collonels, Fenwick, Widdrington and Aſhly conſiſting in 2500 men beſides Reformades and Volunteers; who preſented a Petition to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein they humbly deſired,
<q>That all of their Nation might be aſſigned a particular Quarter, and be commanded apart, that if they behaved themſelves like Men they might have the honour due to their Courage, but if they did ill that they only might bear the diſgrace of their Cowardice, there being no reaſon they ſhould ſuffer for the miſcarriages of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42023:30"/>others.</q> The Prince readily granted their requeſt, and ordered them a ſeparate Poſt under Fenwick the Eldeſt Collonel, and they accordingly ſignaliz'd their valour during the Siege; Which was carried on with the utmoſt Conduct and Reſolution, his Highneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually animating his Souldiers by his Preſence, and teaching them by his example to contemn danger; Many of the Outworks were taken with great ſlaughter on either ſide, but were again ſupplied by the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried induſtry of the Beſieged; In one of theſe Aſſaults his Highneſs, who continually expoſed his Perſon, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Muſket Shot in the Arm, but to prevent his Men from being diſcouraged he pluckt off his Hat with the ſame Arm, and waved it about his head. But the Confederate Army being weakened both by ſickneſs and the many Attacks againſt the Town, and the Germans not bringing in their promiſed ſupplies, a Council of War was called, in the Princes Camp, and there being advice, that Monſieur Schomberg was coming with all the French Forces for the relief of the Town, it was concluded to raiſe the Siege, and ſo this Campaign ended without ſucceſs, occaſioned by the weakneſs of the Spaniards, and the uncertainty of the German Councils, and ſoon after his Highneſs finding that Schomberg was ſatisfied with relieving Maſtricht, and not to be brought to a Battel, He returned back to the Hague, where in a General Aſſembly of the States he gave an account of the Summers Expedition, ſo much to their ſatisfaction, that he received their Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and new returns of thanks for the many toils, hardſhips, and dangers, to which he had expoſed his Perſon for the preſervation of his Country; In Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember following his Highneſs received an account that the Imperial Army had taken Philipſburg, for want of being well provided, which was as unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the raiſing the Siege of Maſtricht.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42023:31"/>
               <p>The following Winter was ſpent in Treating the Peace at Nimegen, which the Common People of Holland were very deſirous of, the War being a great hindrance to their Trade, but the French inſiſted upon ſuch high Terms that his Highneſs oppoſed it to the utmoſt, though K. Charles II. was ſtill very earneſt to bring his dear Ally out of his Troubles; But ſtill the French purſued the War with their uſual applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for in February 1677. though it were in the depth of Winter, their Forces marched into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands, and having provided ſufficient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, they in a manner blockt up Valenciennes, Cambray and St. Omers at a diſtance, giving out they would be Maſters of two, if not of three places before the Confederates could take the Field. The French at the ſame time broke into Germany on the other ſide the Rhyne, ravaging, burning, and ruining theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys with a barbarity peculiar to the moſt Chriſtian King; Soon after the City of Valenciennes was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with an Army of 40 or 50000 men, under the D. of Luxemburg, wherein was a Garriſon of 2000 Foot, and about 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, and the French King being arrived in the Camp, commanded that the Beſieged ſhould be kept awake all night by flinging Bombs, Granadoes and Fire pots into the Town, and the next morning when they were tired with the nights Toil, and gone to their repoſe, ſo that few were left to guard the Works, the Aſſailants car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all before them and turned the great Guns upon the Town, which ſo terrified the Beſieged that they preſently ſurrendred at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Animated with this ſucceſs the French King imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſate down before Cambray a Town of great Trade and had been in the Spaniards hands about 80 years; It had a Garriſon of 1400 Horſe, and four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot, and after a few days Siege this City was, like the other Spaniſh Towns, ſurrendred upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42023:31"/>Articles; And at the ſame time St. Omers was beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of Orleans with a very great Army; The news of this ſudden progreſs of the French ſo alarm'd all the Netherlands that his Highneſs the Prince of Orange was reſolved to take the Field, the Dutch having reseived their payments from Spain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to continue the War another Campaign, being brought to this reſolution by the vigour and courage of his Highneſs, who had begun to prepare his Troops to march upon the firſt motion of the French; But by the uſual delays and neglects of the Spaniards, though the Prince uſed the utmoſt diligence and application, yet he could not arrive ſoon enough to ſuccour Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes and Cambray; But was now reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Battel to endeavour the relief of St. Omers; At Mount Caſſal both Armies met, where after a ſharp encounter, wherein his Highneſs ſhewed the utmoſt bravery, the French themſelves confeſſing, That the Prince that day withſtood no leſs than thirty nine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions of Foot, and an hundred equadrons of Horſe, he made ſuch an honourable retreat as wanted little of a Victory, which was occaſioned by the plain Flight of his men, whom he was forced to reſiſt like Enemies; Of which the States General were ſo ſenſible that in anſwer to his Letter wherein his Highneſs gave them an account of what had paſſed, they ſent him another, returning their unfeigned thanks to his Highneſs for his indefatigable pains and care, not ſparing his own Perſon; Of which they beſought him to be more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the future, conſidering the great importance thereof for the preſervation of his Countrey. After this followed the Surrender of the Cittadel of Cambray which had held out till now, though the Town was taken; And likewiſe St. Omers, which after a vigorous reſiſtance wherein the French loſt many conſiderable Officers, was ſurrendred upon Articles.</p>
               <p>After this the French King returned to Paris, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42023:32"/>Crequi to oppoſe the Duke of Lorrain; and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg to obſerve the motions of the Prince of Orange, who July 23. 1677, having recruited his own Army, and received ſeveral Auxiliary ſupplies from the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes, marched in the Head of them (for the Confederates had all ſubmitted to his Conduct) from Aloft to attack the French lying under the Walls of Aeth, but finding Luxemburg ſo advantagiouſly poſted between two Rivers that he could not be forced to a Battel, He marched to Charleroy, and inſtantly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered that Town, which had a Gariſon of 4 or 5000 French under the command of Count Montal, who miſtruſting the deſign had furniſhed it with all manner of Ammunition and Proviſion, and ſuch a number of great Guns that he had ſent away a good part of them; The D. of Luxemburg hearing his Highneſs was ſate down before the City, drained all the Garriſons of the French Conqueſts, and having made up a Body of 40000 men, poſted himſelf ſo ſtrongly, having a Wood upon his right Wing, and a River before him, that there was no forcing his Trenches, neither could the Confederates fetch any Forrage from the Countrey beyond the Sambre, from whence they uſed to be ſupplied; All which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſidering, drew off and marched to Sembreef, thereby to preſerve his Army wherein conſiſted the ſafety of his Country; though no man was ever more daring when there was any probability of prevailing. His Highneſs finding the French were reſolved not to come to a Battel, but to be upon the defenſive, and ſecure what they had gotten, leaving the Army near Bruſſels under Count Waldeck, returned to the Hague, and had the thanks of the States returned him a ſecond time for his wary and prudent Conduct.</p>
               <p>In October this year, his Highneſs went over into England, at the invitation of King Charles, in hopes that his preſence would much contribute to a general
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42023:32"/>Peace between France and the Confederates, which the King ſeemed very ſollicitous to have concluded, by the inſtigation as it was thought of the French Court, who were willing to put an end to the War for the preſent; The Prince Oct. 19. arrived at Harwich, and went Poſt to Newmarket where the Court then was, which in two or three days returned to Whitehall, where his Highneſs having a ſight of the Princeſs was ſo pleaſed therewith, that he immediately made ſuit to the King and Duke that ſhe might be his Bride, which they ſeemed well pleaſed with, if a Peace were firſt concluded; But his Highneſs abſolutely reſuſing that condition, the King being very well ſatisfied of his Highneſs excellent Merits reſolved to grant his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the next day declared in Council his deſign of marrying the Prince of Orange with the Princeſs Mary; Upon which the whole Council went in a body to complement the Prince and Princeſs; and the news was received both in City and Countrey with Bells, Bonfires and other ſigns of extraordinary joy and ſatisfaction, and they were married accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Nov. 4. 1677. being his Highneſs Birthday.</p>
               <p>Yet amidſt theſe Nuptial Joys and Careſſes his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs knowing how neceſſary his preſence was in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land made haſte to return; So that he departed from London Nov. 29. with his Princeſs, and arriving at Homſlaer dyke ſtaid there till they made their publick entry at the Hague, which they did in a few days, in as magnificent a manner, as both the Magiſtrates and People could expreſs to declare their joy and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for theſe happy Nuptials.</p>
               <p>In 1678. even in January the French King made ſuch mighty Preparations for the enſuing Campaign, as alarm'd all Europe, but more eſpecially the Dutch and their Allies: So that the King of England ſent the Earl of Feverſham with a Project of Peace to the French King, conſiſting of ſeveral heads, which if ſhould reſuſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42023:33"/>to accept of that, then King Charles and the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral would unite their Forces to compel him to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; The French rejected the King's Propoſitions, continuing his mighty Warlike Preparations; Upon which King Charles recalled his Forces out of the French Service, who had often occaſioned his gaining many conſiderable Victories, and the Parliament meeting ſoon after the King acquainted them, That he had made an Alliance with Holland to compel the King of France to a reaſonable Peace; Upon which the Commons gave Money for raiſing 30000 Land Souldiers, and a Fleet of 90 Men of War; Though it appeared afterward the Court never intended any War, but to have uſed theſe Forces to far worſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, even to the advancing Arbitrary Government and Popery in theſe Kingdoms, of which the Dutch were ſo ſenſible that much doubting the ſincerity of K. Charles his Negotiations, they were at laſt conſtrained to make Peace with the French upon diſadvantagious Terms to pacifie the Factions and Diſcontents of the People.</p>
               <p>The French King in March, this year came before Gaunt with an Army of 80000 Men, and by inceſlant Batteries and Stormings took it in nine days time; having drawn the Spaniſh Forces toward Mons under pretence of Beſieging it; And then fell upon Ipre with ſuch rapid violence that he ſoon reduced that likewiſe, though with ſuch loſs of Officers and Souldiers that he put his Army into Garriſons, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Paris; This gave ſuch a mighty Alarm to the Hollanders, that all things drove on violently for a Peace; Which the French King being ſenſible of, and having now gained his point in Flanders, to prevent the Engliſh from being in earneſt againſt him, He ſends an Imperious Project of a Peace declaring he would admit of theſe conditions and no other, which the Dutch were obliged to accept of, ſince they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no better; But before the Peace was ratified the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42023:33"/>French made ſeveral Pretenſions and Delays in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming even what themſelves had agreed to, as his Highneſs the P. of Orange foreſaw and foretold they would do, inſomuch that they blockt up the City of Mons a chief Frontier of Flanders; Upon which his Highneſs reſolved to march to the relief of it, great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations being made to that purpoſe, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Confederates had joined the Holland and Spaniſh Forces that lay near the Canal of Bruſſels, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted by Night from the Hague, and marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mons with his Armv, being accompanied with the Duke of Monmouth, he fell upon the Duke of Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg with ſuch fury that he forced him to retire, and animating his Souldiers, with his Eyes ſparkling like Fire, they deſpiſed all danger by their gallant Generals example, who in the midſt of Fire, and Smoak, and Bullets flying thick as Hail, adventured ſo far that he had been in eminent danger had not Monſieur Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk oppoſed himſelf againſt a daring Captain that was juſt ready to charge the Prince with a full Career, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him dead on the place. The Horſe all this while were lookers on, not being able to advance into the the narrow Paſſages and ſteep Deſcents, ſo that all the weight lay on the Foot and Dragoons; Night coming on, the Duke of Luxemburg drew off in great ſilence and confuſion, leaving to his Highneſs, as certain marks of Victory, the Field of Battel, his Tents, Baggage, wounded Men, ſtore of Powder and other Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The States General appointed Commiſſioners to congratulate his Highneſs for this Victory gained, with ſo much reputation and glory, beſeeching him withal to be careful of his Illuſtrious Perſon, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tranquillity of his Countrey, and the repoſe of the Church and Proteſtant Religion depended ſo much thereon.</p>
               <p>The very day this memorable Battel was fought the Peace between the Dutch and French was ſigned at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42023:34"/>Nimegen, of which intelligence was brought to his Highneſs the next morning, who would elſe have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the advantages he had gained to the full relief of the Town, having already in ſpight of ſo many diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, from an Army ſo ſuddenly drawn together, and ſo haſty a march as that of the Dutch, taken divers Poſts fortified with ſo much skill and induſtry by the French, and attacqued them with a reſolution and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor that at firſt ſurprized them, and after an obſtinate and bloudy Fight ſo diſordered them, that though the night prevented the end of the action, yet it was verily believed, that if the Prince had been at liberty next day to purſue it with 7 or 8000 Engliſh, which were ready to join his Army, he muſt in all appearance not only have relieved Mous, but made ſuch an impreſſion into France as had been often deſign'd but never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſince the War began; Upon which a French Officer preſent ſaid, <hi>That he eſteemed this the only Heroick Action that had been done in the whole courſe and progreſs of it.</hi> The Prince having received advice of the Peace ſent a Deputy with the News to the Duke of Luxemburg, who deſired to ſee the Prince, and accordingly met him in the Field in the Head of his Chief Officers, where all Civilities paſſed between them proper for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and the French with great carioſity crowded about this young Prince, who had the day before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuch a deſperate Action as that of St. Dennis was eſteemed to be; So that his Highneſs could not have ended the War with greater Glory, nor with greater ſpight to ſee ſuch a great occaſion wreſted out of his hand by the ſudden and unexpected ſigning of the Peace, which he had aſſured himſelf the States General would not have conſented to without the Spaniards; Yet upon the certain News of it, he drew back his Army, returned to the Hague, and left the States to purſue their own meaſures in order to finiſh the Treaty betwixt France and Spain.</p>

               <p>During which the King of England ſent over a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon of Honour to the States General, to acquaint them how much he was ſurprized at the news of their ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a particular Treaty with France, even without the incluſion of Spain, declaring that if they would refuſe to ratifie what their Miniſters had ſigned at Nimegen, His Majeſty would immediately declare War againſt France, and carry it on with all vigour purſuant to the Treaty lately entred into with them. All men were much amazed at this ſudden Turn of the Court of England, and the Prince complained,
<q>That nothing was ever more hot and cold, nor any Councils ever more unſteady than thoſe of England, ſince if this Diſpatch had come twenty days before, it might have changed the face of Affairs in Chriſtendom, and have obliged the French to ſuch Terms of Peace as ſhould have left the World in quiet for many years to come, but would now have no effect at all;</q> Which happened accordingly, for at laſt it appeared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from the diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, which extreamly alarm'd the People and Parliament who were much diſturbed at the Treacherous Deſigns of our Court, in promoting the Popiſh and French Intereſt, and thereby forcing the Dutch to comply with that King almoſt upon his own Terms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to divert the humour, King Charles pretended to be in earneſt for engaging in a War againſt France; which for ſome time hinder'd the Ratification of the Treaty, and Engliſh Forces were daily tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Flanders, as if the War were really to have been carried on, which encouraged thoſe that were againſt the Peace in Holland, and occaſioned the Spaniards to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it.</p>
               <p>But the French King being unwilling to loſe the great Advantages he had obtained by this Treaty, reſolved to remove all difficulties, and ſatisfie the States in their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42023:35"/>demands: Yea he diſpatched Ambaſſadors to the Hague with full Authority to remit all the differences about the Treaty with Spain and himſelf to their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which raiſed in the States ſuch a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſincerity of that Kings proceedings, that they quickly adjuſted all matters in conteſt between the two Crowns, ſo that the Treaty was ſigned Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 20. 1678. The other Confederates as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror the King of Denmark, the Duke of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, &amp;c. were very much inraged that they were left to treat ſingly with their potent Enemy, who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſevere Conditions from them, ſo that the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Treaty with Spain being hereby delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the French King to quicken it, ſent Marſhal de Humieres with a great Army into Fianders, plundering and burning all before them, and putting theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries under Contribution with ſo much fury and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that the common people complained heavily of the Calamities and Miſeries which they undeſervedly ſuffered by the flowneſs of the Spaniſh Conncils; ſo that at length both the Spaniard and Emperor were obliged to comply with the offers of France, who elſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a few days to make the Terms much higher. The other Princes, though they very much reſented this ſudden Concluſion of a Peace at ſuch diſadvantage, yet knowing their own inability, were forced to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to make a ſeparate Peace for themſelves. The King of England obſerving that he could not hinder it, ſent his Plenipotentiaries again to Nimegen to ſign the General Treaty; but in the interval ſome new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ariſing between the Spaniards and French, the States General were very diligent to compoſe them, the Tranſactions being ſeldom managed by them but in the preſence of His Highneſs the Prince of Orange, whoſe prudence was ſtill conſulted in matters of gre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulty; he himſelf diſcovering an extraordinary Generoſity, that while others preferr'd Points of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42023:35"/>before the publick Peace, His Highneſs quitted his own Intereſt in poſt-poning his demands for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the devaſtations in his own Eſtates and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, ſo as not to impede the Tranquillity of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, many of his Lands being ruined and deſtroyed in the Spaniſh Netherlands and other adjacent parts; Of which and ſeveral other injuſtices in ſeizing upon His large poſſeſſions in other places, though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Guelderland, Zealand, and Utrecht, made loud complaints againſt the French in his Highneſs behalf, yet could the Prince obtain no ſatisfaction; But the States and their Subjects being quite tired out out with the War, the General Peace was ſigned in January 1678. And the Engliſh Mediators were called home by that King, who was fully imployed at home about the matter of the Popiſh Plot, which both Houſes of Parliament and the generality of the Nation believed to be real, though the King and ſome of the Court credited no more of it than what themſelves were concerned in, and the Prince of Orange at that time told a publick Miniſter, <hi>That He had reaſon to be confident that the King was a Roman Catholick though he durſt not profeſs it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Europe for the preſent was left in a General Peace, though the French King ſoon after made ſuch ſhameful pretences to the Dependancies upon his late Conqueſts both in Flandets and Germany, that he gained more after the Peace, than by his Arms in the War, no Prince nor State being either willing or able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him therein; Theſe diſputes began in 1681 and continued ſome years, at which time that King likewiſe began to raiſe a violent Perſecution againſt his own Proteſtant Subjects, proceeding from the Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ingratitude peculiar to Lewis the XIV. For it is well known that for the ſignal Services which they performed to Henry IV. His Grand-Father in aſſerting the Rights of the Crown againſt the Papiſts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42023:36"/>who were then in rebellion againſt him, that great Prince in acknowledgment thereof confirmed to them an Edict for the free exerciſe of their Religion, which was called the Edict of Nants, whereby they were to enjoy all Liberties and Priviledges, both in Religious and Civil matters, and to be as capable of all Offices and Imployments as his other Subjects. This he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhould be inviolable, and it was accordingly confirmed both by his Son Lewis XIII. and likewiſe by the preſent King upon a very remarkable occaſion; For he being very Young when he aſcended the Throne, the Prince of Conde ſoon after raiſed a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War in the Kingdom againſt him, but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants by their unſhaken Loyalty to him, defeated the deſigns of his enemies, and ſetled that Crown upon His Head which he wears this day, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Service he ſeemed to be ſo ſenſible that in 1652. he made a publick Declaration of it at St. Germans, and every one endeavoured to exceed in proclaiming the merits of the Proteſtants, the Queen Mother her ſelf acknowledging that they had preſerved the State; But ſince by the Maxims of the Roman Religion, No Faith is to be kept with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; the Jeſuits and Miniſters of State endeavoured to inſtil into the Kings mind this Treacherous Notion, That ſince the Proteſtants were ſo potent to advance the King, they might likewiſe upon another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remove him again, from this infernal reaſoning, without their having given the leaſt umbrage or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſloyalty, it was reſolved they muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ruined.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſo ſoon as the Kingdom was ſetled in Peace the Proteſtant Towns of Rochel, Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, &amp;c. Which had ſhewed the greateſt Zeal for the Kings ſervice, were plundred by the Souldiers and otherwiſe impoveriſht; Then their Churches and Exerciſes of Religion were prohibited them, under
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42023:36"/>falſe pretences that they exceeded the Grants allowed them; Yea in matters of Law, Religion was urg'd by the Advocates at the inſtigation of the Prieſts, ſo that they cryed out,
<q>I plead againſt a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, an enemy to the State and to the Kings Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whom he would have to be deſtroyed.</q> So that the Judge durſt not do them juſtice for fear of being counted a Favourer of Hereticks, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint they were told,
<q>You have your remedy in your own hands, why do not you turn Catholicks.</q> This was ſucceeded by Proceſſes throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to inquire what the Proteſtants had ſaid or done for twenty years paſt about Religion or other matters, and there being no want of perjured Villains to ſwear what was abſolutely falſe, the Judges, though ſenſible of it, incouraging them therein, the Priſons were ſoon filled, and many innocent and virtuous Perſons were whipt and ſent to the Gallies for Slaves. Next they were deprived of all publick Offices and imployments, contrary to an expreſs Article in the Edict of Nants, yea were forbid to exerciſe ſeveral Arts and Trades for maintaining their Families.</p>
               <p>This was in 1669. and in 1680. all Lords and Gentlemen were commanded to diſcharge their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Officers and Servants, Nay they would not ſuffer Proteſtant Midwives to do their Office, but expreſly ordained, That no Woman ſhould receive any aſſiſtance in that condition but from Popiſh Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; And to conſummate their miſeries, they were forbid under ſevere penalties to go out of France to get their bread in other Countreys, whereby they were under the horrible neceſſity of periſhing for hunger in their own; They laid ſevere Taxes upon them raiſing the ſum from fourty or fifty Livers to ſeven or eight hundred, and Quartered Dragoons upon them till it was paid; Then an Edict was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that Children of ſeven years old ſhould abjure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42023:37"/>their Religion, forcing their Parents to give them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances beyond their abilities, taking them away, and ſuffering them to ſee them no more; even Perſons of the beſt Quality were thus uſed; Proteſtant Schoolmaſters were prohibited, and three Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſuppreſt, though abſolutely granted by the Edict of Nants; Papiſts were forbid to marry Proteſtants or Miniſters to hinder People directly or indirectly from turning Papiſts. Theſe and a multitude of other cruel and barbarous oppreſſions they greaned under, when the Elector of Brandenburg being pleaſed to interceed on their behalf the King aſſured him,
<q>He was very well ſatisfied with the behaviour of his Proteſtant Subjects and that ſo long as he lived no wrong ſhould be done them;</q> And yet at the ſame inſtant, with his uſual ſincerity, he gave order for demoliſhing ſeveral of their Churches, and ſhutting up others, impriſoning their Miniſters, and uſing divers manifeſt injuſtices againſt thoſe he pretended to protect.</p>
               <p>At this time ſome of the Perſecuted People ſent their Children to Orange as being a Soveraign Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality to finiſh the courſe of their Studies in ſecurity. But this ſo diſpleaſed the King that He ſent a Body of two thouſand men under his Lieutenant General in Languedock, who poſitively commanded the Prince of Oranges Magiſtrates to ſend away all the Children home again, and not to receive any more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into their Univerſity or Schools, which though it appeared very unreaſonable, yet the magiſtrates to prevent further miſchief complyed therewith, and thought they had thereby given full ſatisfaction to his demands, but were ſtrangely ſurprized to hear that during the Capitulation the Lieutenant General ſtill approached with his forces nearer the City, and that he had abſolute Orders to demoliſh their Walls; In ſhort he advanced, and Quartered eight Companies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42023:37"/>of Dragoons in the Citizens Houſes where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many diſorders, conſtraining as well the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as the other Subjects of His Highneſs in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages round about to aſſiſt at the ruine of their own Walls and Towers, which were blown up; At which the People laboured the more earneſtly to be the ſooner rid of thoſe Arbitrary Gueſts, who were ſaid to have already vitiated ſeveral Virgins. The Prince having news hereof, repreſented their Caſe to the States General, as a breach of the laſt Peace, deſiring them to ſignifie their juſt reſentment of theſe unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable proceedings of the French King, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reparations for ſuch horrid violations inſtantly upon concluding a General Peace, and without the leaſt provocation given.</p>
               <p>The States accordingly by their Ambaſſador repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it as an Infraction of the Peace of Nimegen, and required ſatisfaction for the damages which the Prince and his Subjects had ſo Illegally and contrary to the Faith of Treaties and Leagues ſuſtained. But could have only this anſwer from the French Court, That as to the money extorted from the Inhabitants it was done without the Kings Order, and he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſtitution to be made; That upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the People to his will and pleaſure he had withdrawn his Forces out of the Principality and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored free commerce to the Inhabitants according to their deſires; And for the reſt he had reaſon for what he had done.</p>
               <p>After the Peace was concluded his Highneſs applyed himſelf to reform the Government of Utrecht, and other Towns, and likewiſe to concert matters with the States General for the future ſecurity of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey againſt the Treacheries and falſe pretentions of France; The Prince being uſually preſent in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Debates of the Aſſembly both as to Peace and War, who always appeared no leſs prudent and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42023:38"/>to prevent diſorders at home than to repel For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Hoſtility: In July 1681. His Highneſs came over into England, and arriving at Whitehall Dined at Sir Stephen Foxes, and then went to Windſor where the Court then was, and having continued here about Ten Days returned back to Holland,</p>
               <p>In the Interval of Affairs his Highneſs retired to Dieren or Soeſtdyke to divert himſelf, and at other times made progreſſes to take a review of the Frontier Towns belonging to the State, who in 1682. had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Towns of Breda, Grave, and Naerden to be ſtrongly fortified, and it was propoſed in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States to raiſe 16000 men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them with the Old Regiments and to add a New Squadron of twenty four Men of War, both to prevent any ſudden Inſults of the French upon their Territories, and to aſſiſt the Spaniards if they ſhould commit any Acts of Hoſtility which was much to be ſuſpected, conſidering the ſhameful pretenſions that King ſet up of Dependancies in the Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
               <p>In 1682. the Marqueſs of Grana was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Flanders of which he gave notice to the States General and the Prince, and ſoon after His Highneſs had an Interview with the Marqueſs between Breda and Antwerp, where they entred into Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences about their future managements of Affairs; His Highneſs likwiſe viſiting the Fortified Places in Flanders belonging to the States, being accompanied with the Princeſs, who was received with all kind of Reſpect and Splendor by the Cities of Bruſſels, Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, &amp;c. About this time the Count de Avaux the French Ambaſſador arriving at the Hague put in a Memorial to the Aſſembly of the manner how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to receive Audience; But the States replyed, That the things which he deſired were wholly new and never practiſed before, and therefore they can in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42023:38"/>no wiſe comply with them; Whereupon his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was put off till he was willing to receive it upon the former Terms. In November this year the Envoy of Moſcovy came to wait upon the Prince then at Soeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyke to give an account that the great Czar was dead, and that the two Princes now reigning were advanced to the Throne.</p>
               <p>In the end of 1683. The K. of Spain being no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er able to ſuffer the continual Invaſions of the French upon his Cities and Towns in Flanders, and his cruel Treatment of his Subjects for not paying unjuſt and unreaſonable Contributions, he proclaimed War againſt him both by Sea and Land, and ordered all the Effects of the French Merchants in his Dominions to be ſeized; And ſent to the States General to aſſiſt him in this juſt defenſive War, who thereupon concluded to raiſe a conſiderable Force, both for his aid and their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and accordingly his Highneſs gave out ſeveral Commiſſions, and ſent 8000 men toward Flanders. In the mean time the French King according to his uſual method, having ordered great Detachments to be ſent from all the Conquered Places toward Valenciennes, in April 1684. he himſelf accompanied with the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin and Dauphineſs came from Paris thither. The P. was very deſirous to have perfected the new Levies and to have marcht at the Head of them to oppoſe him, but the obſtinacy of Amſterdam and ſome other Towns which refuſed to allow their Quota for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, prevented his Highneſs worthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; The French King having muſtred his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Conde and Valenciennes, he immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted the City of Luxemburg, and though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor made a very notable defence, and the French loſt a conſiderable number of Men, yet the greatneſs of their Army, which was poſted ſo as to prevent any relief, at length obliged the Town to Capitulate, and June 7. following it was ſurrendred upon Articles,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42023:39"/>and ſoon after a Trace being made with Spain they were forced to ſuffer the loſs of this City with the ſame temper as they had done many before.</p>
               <p>And as the French King continued thus Tyrannically to injure his Neighbours ſo he Treacherouſly proceeded to exerciſe horrid cruelties upon his own Proteſtant Subjects, for though he had reſolved upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet at the ſame time he declared, That he had not the leaſt intention to infringe the Edict of Nants, and accordingly in 1684. he abſolutely concluded to cancel and make void that Edict, and to baniſh all the Miniſters out of the Kingdom, and ſeveral young Prieſts were ſent about the Country to inflame the Mobile againſt the Proteſtants; and it was declared in Print,
<q>That the Catholick Faith muſt be planted by Fire and Sword, alledging the example of a King of Norway who converted the Nobles of his Countrey by threatning them to ſlay their Children before their Eyes, if they would not conſent to have them Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and to be Baptized themſelves.</q> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were very ſenſible of the miſchiefs deſign'd againſt them, and expoſed their grievances to the K. with all humility and ſubmiſſion, which produced no other effect upon his Tyrannical Temper than to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their deſtruction by open force and violence, in ſo terrible a manner as is ſcarce to be parallell'd, At firſt they quartered Troops of bloudy and deſperate Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons upon them, who loudly bellowed,
<q>That the K. would no longer ſuffer any Proteſtants in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that they muſt reſolve to change their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or elſe to ſuffer the utmoſt cruelty that could be inflicted upon them,</q> To which theſe innocent Souls, replied,
<q>That they were ready to Sacrifice their Lives and Eſtates for the Kings Service, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences being Gods, they could not in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpoſe of them;</q> This anſwer did but inrage their helliſh Adverſaries, ſo that they firſt ſeized their goods,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42023:39"/>and then fell on their Perſons inflicting all the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities imaginable to induce them to renounce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; They hung up Men and Women by the Hair of the Head, or by the Feet within their Chimneys ſmoaking them with wiſps of wet Straw; They threw them into great fires &amp; pluckt them thence half roaſted; They tied them on the Rack, &amp; poured wine down their Throats till the fame had deprived them of their reaſon; and then made them ſay they would be Catholicks; They ſtript them ſtark naked &amp; larded them all over with Pins from head to foot; They kept them from ſleeping 7 or 8 days and nights together; They tied Parents to Bed poſts and raviſhed their Daughters before their eyes; They pluckt off the Nails from the Hands and Toes of others with moſt intolerable pain, and after theſe and a thouſand other horrid indignities, if they refuſed to abjure their Religion, they threw them into cloſe dark &amp; ſtinking Dungeons exerciſing upon them all manner of inhumanity; And yet after all theſe barbarous uſages they compelled thoſe wretched People who had not courage and conſtancy enough to perſiſt in the Faith, and therefore turned Catholicks, or new Converts, as they called them, to acknowledge,
<q>That they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Roman Religion of their own accord;</q> And had the impudence to declare even againſt the evidence of Millions of Witneſſes;
<q>That force and violence had no ſhare in the Converſions, but that they were ſoft, calm and voluntary, and that if there were any Dragoons concerned therein, it was becauſe the Proteſtants themſelves, deſired them that they might have a handſome pretence to change their Religion.</q> In the mean time their Houſes were demoliſhed, their Lands deſtroyed, their Woods cut down, and their Wives and Children ſeized, and put into Monaſteries; and an Edict was publiſhed for pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down all the Proteſtant Churches in the Kingdom; and all for promoting the Catholick Peligion; Yea the miſchief did not terminate here, for the French
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42023:40"/>King being too potent to be reſiſted by the Duke of Savoy, He compell'd that Prince to publiſh an Edict for prohibiting the poor Waldenſes and Vaudois to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Religion upon pain of death, and being aſſiſted with a great number of French Troops under Monſieur Catinat, the Souldiers committed the like Violences and Barbarities againſt them as they had done in France.</p>
               <p>His Highneſs the Prince of Orange highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of theſe Proceedings, and was a ſilent Mourner for the miſeries of the Proteſtant Church, which now ſeemed to be threatned more than ever, for King Charles II. dying in February 1685. the D. of York ſucceeded him, who inſtantly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Roman Catholick. And June 10 following the Duke of Monmouth landed with 150 Men at Lime in Dorſetſhire, declaring,
<q>That he had taken Arms for the defence and vindication of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the Laws, Rights, and Priviledges of England, from the Invaſion made upon them, and for delivering the Kingdom from the Tyranny of James Duke of York;</q> About the ſame time the Earl of Argile ſetting ſail from the Vlye in Holland landed in the Weſt of Scotland, publiſhing a Declaration to the ſame purpoſe, but either by weakneſs or treachery they were both ſoon defeated, and both beheaded, and a multitude of their followers executed; For which great ſucceſs King James publiſhed a Proclamation for a Thankſgiving, and among other expreſſions ſays;
<q>That nothing now remained which could poſſibly diſturb the future quiet of his Reign;</q> In confidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he with the advice of his Popiſh Counſellors and their Adherents, proceeded to commit ſeveral open violations upon the Laws of the Land and the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Some time before, his Highneſs returning from Hounſleyrdike to the Hague, gave audience to ſeveral Forreign Miniſters, and parted thence to viſit the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42023:40"/>of Maeſtricht, Boiſleduck and other Places, and in his return was met by the Princeſs at Loo, having in his progreſs given all neceſſary Orders for the well governing and ſtrengthning of thoſe Places. In Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1687. the Marqueſs de Albeville Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary from the King of England had Audience of his Highneſs and the States of Holland, and about the ſame time the States conſidering the danger that might ariſe from the great number of Forreign Popiſh Prieſts (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the interceſſion of the Envoy of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Germany on their behalf) they made a Decree commanding them to retire out of the Netherlands, and never to return again, promiſing a reward of 100 Ducatoons to any that ſhould make diſcovery, and laying a penalty of 600 Florins upon thoſe that ſhould harbour or conceal any of them, for the firſt offence, 1200 for the ſecond, and corporeal puniſhment for the third, whereupon many of them went over into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where their hopes and expectations of having their Religion ſetled daily increaſed.</p>
               <p>The King of England being unwilling to afford any aſſiſtance to the Heretical States againſt his dear Ally the French King, publiſhed a Proclamation in March 1687. commanding the return of all Subjects then in the Service of the States General either by Sea or Land, with no other Allegation but that the King thought it fit for his ſervice. The States raiſed ſome diſpute with the Marqueſs de Albeville about this matter, refuſing to let them return into England, inſomuch that the Marqueſs ſoon after delivered in a Memorial to the States by expreſs Orders from the King, ſignifying,
<q>That his Maſter was much ſurprized to find that their Lordſhips perſiſted in their Reſolution, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing leave to his Subjects to return into England, and that whereas their Lordſhips alledged that there was nothing ſo agreeable to nature, as that he who was born free ſhould have the right and liberty to ſettle
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42023:41"/>himſelf wherever he ſhould think it moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to him, and that it was in his power to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized and become a Subject to them under whoſe Soveraignty he ſubmits his Perſon, and that the Government receiving him, thereby acquire over him the ſame Right it has over its own proper and natural Subjects.</q> The Marqueſs replied,
<q>That this pretended Natural Liberty could not ſubſiſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Obedience and Dominion had been introduced, ſo that the Rights of Soveraignty and Obedience were now only to be conſidered, and that in virtue of thoſe Rights it had been the common opinion in all times, that no natural ſubject could withdraw himſelf from the Obedience he owed to his Lawful Prince, from whence it was that the Kings of Great Britain had in all times prohibited their Subjects to ingage in any Forreign ſervice, and had recalled them from it, when, and as often as they thought fit.</q> The Marqueſs further inſtanced a Capitulation made between the Earl of Oſſory and his Highneſs the Prince of Orange,
<q>That in caſe the King of Great Britain ſhould recal his Subjects in the Service of the States, they ſhould be permitted to retire, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Capitulation, and his Reaſons alledged, the Marqueſs demanded their diſmiſſion, from which the King would never depart, neither was he willing to doubt of their Lordſhips compliance with it.</q> But it ſeems few or none were willing, for very few return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, judging it may be, that they might do more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice where they were for the intereſt of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey than in fighting at home againſt their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen and Fellow Proteſtants, and as their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs juſtified the reſolution of the States General ſo it rendred the endeavours of the Marqueſs ineflectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; For the States having diſbanded them, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part liſted themſelves again under their Command as well Officers as Souldiers, though the King had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

               <p>In May 1688. The Prince Elector of Saxony was ſplendidly entertained by his Highneſs the Prince of Orange at Homſlaer Dyke, and the next day his Highneſs accompanied him to Scheveling, where they went on board a ſmall Veſſel that carried them to a ſquadron of 17 Men of War, which arrived from Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt under the command of Vice Admiral Allemond, who upon their approach ſent two light Frigats and a Shallop to meet them, and they were ſaluted with the Cannon of all the Ships, when having dined aboard the Vice-Admiral they returned to Scheveling, and from thence his Electoral Highneſs went to viſit Delft, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, Dort, Maeſtricht, Leige, Aix and Cologne, and ſo returned home by the way of Franckfort; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time the Envoy of Brandenburg acquainted the Prince of Orange and the States with the Death of the Elector his Maſter, a Prince extream firm to the Proteſtant Intereſt, and whoſe Death was much regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Proteſtant Princes and States; The Prince and States ſending a Gentleman with Complements of Condoleance to his Son and Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>The King of England having obtained the opinion of his Judges for the Diſpenſing Power ſoon made uſe of it; For firſt he employ'd Popiſh Officers, and put them into chief Command, the Earl of Clarendon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recalled from the Government of Ireland, and the Earl of Tyrconnel a Papiſt ſent to ſucceed him, to the great terror of the Proteſtants of that Kingdom. The Earl of Caſtlemain was ſent Ambaſſador to Rome; An Army was raiſed and Muſtred at Hunſlow Heath; The Lord Biſhop of London was convented before a New and Illegal Court of Judicature for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and ſuſpended from his Office for refuſing to ſuſpend the Reverend Dr. Sharp, under pretence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42023:42"/>that he had uttered ſeditious words in his Sermons; Then a Declaration is publiſhed for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſuſpending all the Penal Laws in matters of Religion, and acquitting all Perſons from taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, both in England, Scotland and Ireland, The Popes Nuncio arrived in England being received with much reſpect by the King, and Dined with the King and the Lord Maver at Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, Popiſh Chappels were erected in ſeveral places in London, and other Cities and Towns in England; The Charters of ſeveral Corporations that were yet unſeized were now taken away; Theſe and divers other Illegal proceedings put the Nation into a ferment, and they were inraged at the Authors of them; Nay, they do not ſtop here, for after this the King again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, with a peremptory Order, to command all the Clergy to read it in their ſeveral Churches and Chappels through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, and that the Biſhops ſhould diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them through their ſeveral Dioceſſes; But the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous proceedings againſt the Lord Biſhop of London the laſt year, and againſt the Vice-Chancellor of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge and the Follows of Magdalen Colledge in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford this year were ſuch evident breaches of his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Tender Conſciences that it gave ſtill greater diſſatisfaction to the Nation, and portended ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alteration; The Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge being deprived of his Office, and ſuſpended of his Headſhip, or refuſing to admit one Alban Francis a Benedictine Monk to be Maſter of Arts without taking the Oaths, by virtue of the Diſpenſing power, though contrary to the Statutes which he was ſworn to maintain; And the fellows of Magdalen Colledge in Oxford being 26 in number for refuſing to admit one Farmer a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Popiſh Prieſt to the Preſidentſhip of that Colledge, and Electing Dr. Hough, were pronourced guilty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his Majeſties Commands and deprived and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42023:42"/>expelled from their reſpective Fellowſhips; And the Biſhops judging that their diſtributing the Declaration would be an owning and aſſerting the Kings aſſumed Diſpenſing Power, and foreſeeing the pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof, the Archbiſhop of Canterbury and ſix others drew up a Petition in behalf of themſelves and their Brethren ſetting forth the Reaſons why they could not comply therewith; This was ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the King and his Popiſh Councellors that the Petition was judged Tumultuary, and all the ſeven Biſhops were committed Priſoners to the Tower; And now the Jeſnits acted their Maſter piece of Policy, as they imagined, though it proved very fural to them; For knowing that the King grew old, and that on his life the hopes of Reſtoring their Religion depended, ſince the Heir Apparent was a Proteſtant who would ſoon ruin all their Machinations. They reſolved if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to advance a Popiſh Succeſſor, and thereby enſure Popery and Slavery to the Nation; Hereupon they raiſed a report ſometime before that the Queen was with Child though the People did not believe it, and ſeveral Lampoons were made upon that Subject; And the Biſhops being now ſecured, this was thought the proper time for the Queen to fall in Labour, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly June 10. 1683. It was publiſhed that ſhe was Delivered of a Frince, for which the King ordered all ſigns of rejoicing to be made, and a day of Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed; as being a thing of mighty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for advancing the Catholick Cauſe; though the joy was ſomewhat abated by the Acquittal of the ſeven Biſhops five days after, who being Tried at the Kings Bench Bar were brought in Not Guilty, at which the People, yea the Kings own Army at Hounſlow Heath, ſhouted for joy, to the ſevere mortification of the Court.</p>
               <p>The King having declared that he intended to call a Parliament to turn his Declaration of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42023:43"/>into a Law, and likewiſe to abrogate all the Penal Laws and Teſts both againſt the Diſſenters and the Roman Catholicks, the Jeſuits had a great deſire to ſound the intentions and thoughts of their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the Prince and Princeſs of Orange, upon that Subject; To which purpoſe Mr. James Steward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write a Letter to Penſionary Fagell not without the knowledge and approbation of the King, which occaſioned Minheer Fagels anſwer, to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Their Highneſſes had often declared, as they did more particularly to the Marqueſs Albeville His Majeſties Envoy Extraordinary to the States; That it is their Opinion that no Chriſtian ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for his Conſcience, or be ill uſed becauſe he diſſers from the Publick and Eſtabliſhed Religion; and therefore they could be content that even the Papiſts in England, Scotland, and Ireland might be ſuffered to continue to their Religion with as much Liberty as is allowed the by the States of the United Provinces; And as for the Proteſtant Diſſenters Their Highneſſes did not only conſent, but heartily approve of their having an Intire Liberty, for the full exerciſe of their Religion without any trouble or hindrance. That Their Highneſſes, were ready in caſe His Majeſty of England ſhould deſire it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their willingneſs to concur in the ſetling and confirming this Liberty as far as it lay in them, and were ready if deſired to concur in Repealing the Laws, provided always that thoſe Laws remain ſtill in their full force and vigor whereby the Roman Catholicks are excluded out of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and out of all publick Imployments Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, Civil, and Military, as likewiſe all thoſe other Laws which confirm the Proteſtant Religion, and which ſecure it againſt all the attempts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks. But that Their Highneſſes could
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42023:43"/>not agree to the Repealing of the Teſts, or thoſe Penal Laws that tend to the ſecurity of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, ſince the Roman Catholicks receive no other prejudice from theſe than the being exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Parliaments or from Publick Imployments, and that by them the Proteſtant Religion is covered from all the deſigns of the Roman Catholicks againſt it, or againſt the publick ſafety, and neither the Teſts nor thoſe other Laws can be ſaid to carry in them any ſeverity againſt the Roman Catholicks upon account of their Conſciences, they being only Proviſions Qualifying men to be Members of Parliament or to be capable of bearing Offices, by which they muſt declare before God and Men that they are for the Proteſtant Religion, ſo that all this amounts to no more than a ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion from any prejudice that it may receive from the Roman Catholicks. That Their Highneſſes have thought and do ſtill think that more than this ought not be asked nor expected from them, ſince by this means the Roman Catholicks, and their Poſterity would be for ever ſecured from all Troubles in their Perſons and Eſtates, or in the Exerciſe of their Religion, and that the Roman Catholicks ought to be ſatisfied with this, and not to diſquiet the Kingdom becauſe they cannot be admitted to ſit in Parliament, or to be in imployment; or becauſe thoſe Laws wherein the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion chiefly conſiſts are not repealed, by which they may be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to overturn it; That their Highneſſes alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Diſſenters would be for ever ſatisfied when they ſhould be for ever covered from all danger of being diſturbed or puniſhed for the free Exerciſe of their Religion upon any pretence whatſoever.</q>

<q>although I did not Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that every Perſon here preſent was ſatisfied before, yet by what you have heard, you will be the better able to ſatisfie others; Beſides could I and the Queen have been thought ſo wicked as to impoſe a Child upon the Nation, we ſaw how impoſſible it would have been; neither could I my ſelf have been impoſed upon, having conſtantly been with the Queen during her being with Child, and the whole time of her Labour, and therefore there is none of you but will eaſily believe that I who have ſuffered ſo much for Conſcience-ſake, cannot be capable of ſo great a Viliany, to the prejudice of my own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; I thank God that thoſe that know me know well, that it is my Principle to do as I would be done by, and that I would rather die a thouſand Deaths, than do the leaſt wrong to any of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this Zealous Harangue had but little Influence upon the Generality of the People (with whom the King by his late Actions had wholly forfeited his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation) who daily diſcovered, as far as they durſt, their longing deſires for the Arrival of his Highneſs the Prince of Orange to deliver them from the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Miſchiefs that impended over the Nation.</p>

<q>As that the Prince was returned with his Fleet ſo miſerably Torn and Shattered that he had loſt nine of his Men of War and ſeveral leſſer Veſſels; That 1000 of his Horſe were utterly loſt; that a Calenture was got among the Seamen; that Dr. Butner and ſeveral of the Princes chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were drowned and that the States had an ill opinion of the Expedition in General, ſo that it was

               </p>
               <p>This Stratagem had ſome effect upon the Court, for the Papiſts hopes hereupon began ſo to revive, that the King Ordered the Reſtoring the Charters, and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of Magdalen Colled; the Vacaring the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commiſſion and the other Grants which he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, to be ſuſpended till he heard the Prince was again put to Sea, and thereby made the whole Nation ſenſible how little Truſt or Credit was to be given to his moſt ſolemn Promiſes and Declarations; but all hands being at work the damage that had been ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was repaired in eight days time, ſo that Nov. 3. about ten in the Morning upon a ſignal given the whole Fleet once more ſet Sail; about Midnight an Advice Boat brought Intelligence, that the Engliſh Fleet conſiſting of thirty three Sail lay to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Princes; upon which the Prince fired a Gun which cauſed a great Conſternation through the whole Fleet; but the ſmall Advice Boats Cruiſing for more certain Intelligence brought news, that inſtead of the Engliſh Fleet which had given the Alarm, it was only Admiral Herbert with a part of the Dutch Fleet which had been for ſome hours ſeparated from the main Body; in the Morning the Prince gave a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the Admirals to come aboard of him, and ſoon after the Fleet was got into the North Forelands, at what time the Fleet was Order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Prince now diſplayed a Red Flag at the Mizen yards Arm, while General Mackay with ſix Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot was the firſt that ſet Foot on Shoar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of the little Porpoiſe which was ordered to run her ſelf aground to ſecure their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this was upon Nov. 5. a day memorable to the Engliſh before, but now doubly remarkable for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Deliverance from the Bloody Deſigns of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.

The Sunday following his Highneſs went to the Cathedral, where his Highneſs Declaration of the Reaſons inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of England, for preſerving the Proteſtant Religion, and for reſtoring the Liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland, was read by Dr. Burnet before a numerous Auditory, the Subſtance whereof was.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That 'it was certain and evident to all men, that the publick Peace and Happineſs of any Kingdom and State could not be preſerved, where the Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Cuſtoms, eſtabliſhed by the lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it, were openly tranſgreſt and annull'd, more eſpecially where the Alteration of Religion was endeavoured, and a Religion contrary to the Law Deſign'd to be introduced, whereas they who were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42023:50"/>moſt immediately concerned therein, were indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bound to preſerve the eſtabliſht Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Cuſtoms, and above all, the Religion and Worſhip of God eſtabliſht among them, and to take effectual Care that the Inhabitant of ſuch State or Kingdom might neither be deprived of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor outed of their Civil Rights; more eſpecially ſince the greatneſs of Kings, Royal Families, and all in Authority, as well as the Happineſs of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and People depended in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon an exact Obſervation of thoſe their Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms; upon which ground his Highneſs further declared, That he could no longer forbear to let the World know how apparently he ſaw with regret, that they who had then the chief Credit with the King had overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of theſe Realms, and ſubjected them in all things relating to their Conſciences, Liberties and Properties to Arbitrary Government, and that not only by ſecret and indirect ways, but in an open and undiſguiſed manner; that thoſe Evil Councellors, for advancing and colouring this with ſome plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, did invent and ſet on foot the Kings Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, by virtue of which they pretend that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law he can ſuſpend and diſpenſe with the Execution of the Laws that have been enacted by the Authority of King and Parliament for the Security and Happineſs of the Subject, and to render theſe Laws of no effect, though it is moſt certain that they cannot be ſuſpended, but by the ſame Authority that made them; for though the King may pardon the puniſhment of a Tranſgreſſor in Caſes of Treaſon and Felony, yet it cannot with any colour of Reaſon be thence inferred, that he can intirely ſuſpend the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of thoſe Laws, unleſs he has ſuch an Arbitrary Power that the Laws, Liberties, Honours and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Subjects depend wholly upon his good
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42023:50"/>Will and Pleaſure; and though they have obtained a Sentence for aſſerting this Diſpenſing Power to be a Right depending on the Crown, yet it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that it ſhould be put in the Power of twelve Judges to offer up the Laws, Rights and Liberties of the whole Nation to the Arbitrary Will of the King, eſpecially ſuch as are firſt advanced, and then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be turned out, if they do not comply therein, and ſome Papiſts who are incapable by Law are made Judges.</p>
                  <p>That the King, though known to be a Papiſt, was yet received and acknowledged by the People to be their King, and did ſolemnly Swear and Promiſe at his Coronation, that he would maintain their Laws and Liberties, and the Church of England, as it was eſtabliſht by Law, and though ſeveral Laws have been lately made for preſerving their Liberties, and the Proteſtant Religion, and to prevent all Papiſts from being put into any Imployment, yet theſe evil Councillors have in effect Annulled and Aboliſhed all thoſe Laws, and in direct Oppoſition thereto, have ſet up as Illegal Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, in which one of the Kings Miniſters, who is a Papiſt ſits and Acts, though by Law uncapable of any publick Imployment, that theſe Commiſſioners have ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Biſhop of London, only for refuſing to obey an Order to ſuſpend a Worthy Divine without Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Proceſs; they have turned out the Preſident and Fellows of Hagdalen Colledge without citing them before any Legal Court or Comperent Judge, only for refuſing to chuſe for their Preſident a Perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by theſe Evil Councillors, contrary to the Right of Free Election, and contrary to Magna Charta, <hi>That no man ſhall loſe Life or Goods, but by the Law of the Land;</hi> and afterward put the Colledge wholly into the hands of Papiſts. They have cited before them all the Chancellors and Arch-deacons of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42023:51"/>England, to certifie the Names of the Clergy, who did not read the Kings Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, though the reading of it was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them by the Biſhops, who are their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Theſe Evil Councillors have procured Orders for building ſeveral Popiſh Churches, Chappels, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, Colledges of Jeſuits for corrupting of youth, and raiſed one to be a Privy Councillor and Miniſter of State, contrary to ſeveral expreſs Laws, by the Rules of which they evidently ſhew they are no way reſtrained, and wherein they are ſerved and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo followed the ſame Methods in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Affairs, by procuring Orders to examine all Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, and all others that were in any publick Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, whether they were for taking away the Penal Laws and Teſts, and thoſe who in Conſcience could not comply were turned out, and divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified Perſons put in their Rooms; they have ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the Charters of ſeveral Towns, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſurrender of others, which Elect Parliament men, and placed new Magiſtrates, many of them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, in divers Corporations. They have removed ſuch Judges, as would not in all things Conform to their Deſigns, and put in others, whoſe Compliance they diſowned beforehand, whereby much Blood hath been ſhed in many places of the Kingdom againſt all the Forms and Rules of Law, without Suffering the Perſons accuſed to plead in their own Defence. They have put the Adminiſtration of Juſtice into the Hands of Papiſts, though all their Sentences are Null and Void in Law, and have diſpoſed of all Military Imployments in the ſame manner both by Sea and Land, to Strangers as well as Natives; and Iriſh as well as Engliſh, to maintain and execute their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Deſigns of inſlaving the Nation by their Aſſiſtance.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42023:51"/>In Ireland the whole Government is put into the Hands of Papiſts, ſo that the Proteſtants through ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror have in great numbers left that Kingdom, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned their Eſtates in it, remembring well that Cruel and Bloody Maſſacre in 1641. In Scotland the King has declared himſelf clothed with ſuch an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power, as to be obeyed without Reſerve.</p>
                  <p>Theſe great Oppreſſions, and open Contempts of all Laws, being inſufferable, have put the Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Fears, and to look out for ſuch Lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as are allowed of in all Nations; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from endeavouring to preſerve their Lives and Eſtates by Petition, or other means Authorized by Law, theſe Evil Councillors proceeded with all Rigor againſt thoſe that uſed thoſe Methods, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury and others, who humbly offering their Reaſons, why they could not Order the Declaration of Liberty of Conſcience to be read in the Churches, were ſent to Priſon, and after Tried as if guilty of ſome enormous Crime, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to appear before profeſt Papiſts, and thoſe Judges that gave their Opinion in their favour were turned out. They have alſo Treated a Peer of the Realm, as a Criminal for ſaying, that the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of Peace, becauſe they are put into Imployments contrary to Law.</p>
                  <p>That his Highneſs, and his Deareſt and moſt Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Conſort the Princeſs have ſignified to the King in Terms full of reſpect, the juſt and deep Regret theſe Proceedings have given them, and in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with His deſires have declared their Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Repealing the Penal Laws and Teſts, whereby they hoped there might have been an happy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Subjects of all Perſwaſions, which yet theſe Evil Councillors have ſo miſrepreſented as to endeavour to alienate the King more and more from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42023:52"/>them, as if they deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of the Kingdom; and the laſt and great Remedy for all theſe Evils being the calling of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for ſecuring the Nation againſt the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe Evil Councillors, cannot be eaſily brought about, ſince by a Parliament duly choſen, they doubt to be called to account, for all their open Violations of the Laws, their Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects, their deſigning under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of Liberty of Conſcience, to ſow Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions among Proteſtants, and from their mutual quarrels to carry on their own Deſigns, to prevent which the Electors and Elected for Parliament men are to be beforehand ingaged to comply with their wicked Deſires, and the returns are to be made by Popiſh Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns, ſo that this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy of a Free Parliament is hereby made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</p>
                  <p>And to Crown all, There are great and violent Preſumptions inducing their Highneſſes to believe that theſe Evil Councillors to gain more time to carry on their ill Deſigns, for incouraging their Complices and diſcouraging all good Subjects they have publiſhed, that the Queen hath brought forth a Son, though there appeared both during the Queens pretended bigneſs, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible grounds of Suſpition, that not only their Highneſſes, but all the good Subjects of this Kingdom, vehemently ſuſpect that the pretended Prince of Wales was not born of the Queen; and ſince their Highneſles have both ſo great an Intereſt in this matter, and ſuch a Right as all the World knows to the Succeſſion of the Crown, and ſince the Engliſh Nation had ever teſtified a moſt particular Affection and Eſteem to them both; their Highneſſes cannot excuſe themſelves from eſpouſing their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42023:52"/>in a matter of ſuch high conſequence, and from contributing all that in them lies, for the maintaining both of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of thoſe Kingdoms, and for ſecuring to them the continual Enjoyment of all their juſt Rights.

                  <p>Therefore it is, that his Highneſs hath thought fit to go over into England, and to carry over a Force ſufficient by the Bleſſing of God to defend him from the Violence of thoſe Evil Councillors; His Highneſs declaring, that this Expedition is intended for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Highneſs is likewiſe Confident that all men ſee how little weight is to be laid on all the Promiſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that can be now made, ſince there has been ſo little Regard had to them in times paſt; and the imperfect Redreſs that is now offered, as it is a plain Confeſſion of the Violations of the Government, which his Highneſs hath ſet forth, ſo the defect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appears, ſince they lay down nothing, but what they can can take up at Pleaſure, ſtill reſerving entire their Claims and Pretences to that Abſolute Power, which has been the root of all their Oppreſſion, and the Subverſion of the Government; and it is plain, there can be no remedy, no Redreſs but in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been Invaded, and not by any pretended Acts of Grace, to which the Extremity of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs has driven them; therefore it is that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath thought fit to declare, that he will refer all to a Free Aſſembly of this Nation in a Lawful Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>

               <p>His Highneſs likewiſe ſent the following Letter, to all the Officers and Seamen of the Engliſh Fleet;

You are now at laſt ſenſible, that you are made uſe of only as Inſtruments to bring this Nation under Popery and Slavery, by means of the Iriſh, and other Foreigners, that are aſſembling for your Deſtruction. Therefore we hope that Almighty God will inſpire you with ſuch Thoughts as may facilitate your Deliverance, and preſerve you, your Countrey and Religion from all theſe impending Miſcries. And whereas (in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) this can never be effected, unleſs You joyn with Us (who labour for your Deliverance,) we do expect your Aſſiſtance herein: And ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>The Prince ſent a Letter alſo to the Kings Army to the ſame purpoſe, intimating to them, <q>What they might expect both from the Caſhiering of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Engliſh Officers and Souldiers in Ireland, and by the Iriſh being brought over to be put in their places, when it ſhould be thought convenient for themſelves to be turned out; Hoping withal that they would not be abuſed by a falſe Notion of Honour, but would conſider what they owed to God, their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and their Countrey, Themſelves and their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which were to be prefer'd before all Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations and Engagements whatſoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt his Highneſs continued at Exeter, the King ſeemed very reſolute at London to oppoſe him in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſtering his Army at Hounſlow Heath, and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up for Volunteers in the Streets, though with little

<q>That it was neceſſary for him to reſtore all things to the State wherein he found them, when he came to the Crown, by committing all Offices of Truſt to thoſe qualified by Law, and to redreſs ſuch Grievances as were generally complained of; to put an effectual ſtop to all Diſpenſations, and recal and cancel thoſe which had been obtained of him. To Diſſolve the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, and Promiſe the People never to erect the like for the future. To reſtore the Univerſities to their Legal State, particularly both the Magdalen Colledges, and not permit any to enjoy Preferment, but thoſe qualified by the Statutes of the Univerſity and Laws of the Land. To ſuppreſs the Jeſuits Schools, and grant no more Licenſes to ſuch, being apparently againſt Law, and his own Intereſt. To ſend Inhibitions after thoſe four Romiſh Biſhops, who under the Title of Apoſtolick Vicars, preſumed to exerciſe Illegal Juriſdiction within the Bingdom; to ſuffer no more Quo Warra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To fill up the vacant Biſhopricks with Perſons qualified by Law. To Act no more by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Diſpenting Power, but permit it to be ſetled by Act of Parliament. That upon the Reſtoration of Corporations, he would call a Free Parliament and ſuffer them to ſit, to redreſs Grievances. Laſtly, to permit the Biſhops to lay ſuch Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before him, as by the Bleſſing of God might bring him back to the Communion of the Church of England, into whoſe Catholick Faith, he had been Baptized.</q> Not long after the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, preſented the King the following Petition.</p>

                     <p>We are by innumerable Grievances made ſenſible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Properties are about to be rooted out by our late Jeſuitical Privy-Council, as hath been of late too apparent, 1.

               <q>
                  <p>SIR, with a Heart full of Grief am I forced to write, that Prudence will not permit me to ſay to your Face. And may I e're find Credit with your Majeſty, and Protection from Heaven, as what I now do is free from Paſſion, Vanity, or Deſign, with which, Actions of this Nature, are too often accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied. I am not ignorant of the frequent Miſchiefs wrought in the World by Factious Pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but were not Religion the moſt juſtifiable Cauſe, it would not be made the moſt ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42023:59"/>And your Majeſty has always ſhewn too unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted a Sence of Religion, to doubt the juſt Effects of it in one whoſe Practices have, I hope, never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the World cauſe to cenſure his real Conviction of it; or his backwardneſs to perform what his Honour and Conſcience prompt him to; how then can I long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſguiſe my juſt concern for that Religion, in which I have been ſo happily Educated, which my Judgment throughly convinces me to be the beſt; and for the Support of which I am ſo highly intereſted in my Native Countrey; and is not England now, by the moſt endearing Tye become ſo?</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the reſtleſs Spirits of the Enemies of the REFORMED RELIGION, back'd by the Cruel Zeal of France, juſtly Alarm and Unite all the Proteſtant Princes of Chriſtendom, and engage them in ſo vaſt an Expence for the Support of it, can I Act ſo Degenerous and mean a part, as to deny my Concurrence to ſuch worthy Endeavours for diſabuſing of your Majeſty by the Re-inforcement of thoſe Laws, and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Government, on which alone depends the Well-being of your Majeſty, and of the PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT RELIGION in Europe.

This ſlender ſucceſs was ſoon damped, by an Addreſs from the Fleet, for a Free Parliament; which now began to grow Cold in his Service, and the continual Deſertions of his Army; So that the King not thinking it Convenient to hazard a Battel with them, upon the approach of the Princes Forces, with whom now were a great part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, He recalled his Remainder of them, with the Train of Artillery; and upon his return to White Hall, he appointed Colonel Beril Skelton to be Lieutenant of the Tower, in the place of Sir Edward Hales, and in purſuance of the Advice of the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, Ordered the Chancellor Jefferies to iſſue out writs for ſummoning a Parliament to ſit, Jan. 15. following; the Biſhop of Exeter, who left that City upon the approach of the Prince, was likewiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Arch-Biſhop of York, which had been vacant for ſome time, and was thought to have been deſigned for Father Peters, if things had gone on.

               <q>
                  <p>VVHEREAS on the 8th. of December 1688. at Hungerford, a PAPER Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marqueſs of Hallifax, the Earl of Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the Lord Godolphin, Commiſſioners ſent unto US from his Majeſty, was Delivered to US in theſe Words following, viz.</p>
                  <p>SIR, The King Commandeth us to acquaint You, That he obſerveth all the Differences, and Cauſes of Complaint, alledged by Your Highneſs, ſeem to be referred to a Free-Parliament. His Majeſty as He hath already Declared, was Reſolved before this to call one, but thought that in the preſent State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, it was adviſeable to defer it till things were more Compos'd. Yet ſeeing that His People ſtill continue to deſire it; He hath put forth His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in order to it, and hath Iſſued forth His Writs for the calling of it. And to prevent any Cauſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption in it, He will conſent to every thing that can be reaſonably required for the Security of all thoſe that ſhall come to it. His Majeſty hath therefore ſent Us to attend Your Highneſs for the adjuſting of all Matters that ſhall be agreed to be neceſſary to the Freedom of Elections, and the Security of Sitting, and is ready immediately to enter into a Treaty in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it. His Majeſty propoſeth, that in the mean time the Reſpective Armies may be Reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch Limits, and at ſuch a Diſtance from London, as may prevent the Apprehenſions that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may in any kind be diſturbed, being deſirous that the Meeting of it may be no longer delay'd than it muſt be by the uſual and neceſſary Forms, Signed, Hallifax, Nottingham, Godolphin.</p>

                  <p>WE with the Advice of the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Aſſembled with US, have in Anſwer to the ſame, made thoſe following PROPOSALS. 1. That all Papiſts, and ſuch Perſons as are not qualified by Law, be Diſarmed, Disbanded, and Removed from all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Civil and Military. 2. That all Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations which Reflect upon Us, or any that have come to Us, or declared for Us, be recalled; and that if any Perſons for having ſo Aſſiſted, have been committed, that they be forthwith ſet at Liberty. 3. That for the Security and Safety of the City of London, the Cuſtody and Government of the Tower be immediately put into the hands of the ſaid City. 4. That if His Majeſty ſhall think fit to be at London, during the Sitting of the Parliament, that we may be there alſo, with an equal Number of Our Guards. Or if his Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to be in any place from London, at what-ever diſtance he thinks fits that We may be at a place of the ſame diſtance. And that the reſpective Armies do remove from London Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles, and that no more Foreign Forces be brought into the Kingdom. 5. That for the Security of the City of London and their Trade, Tilbury Fort be put into the hands of the ſaid City. 6. That to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Landing of French or other Foreign Troops, Port mouth may be put into ſuch hands, as by Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Us ſhall be agreed upon. 7. That ſome ſufficient part of the Publick Revenue be Aſſigned Us, for the Maintaining of our Forces, until the Meeting of a Free Parliament.</p>

               <p>But theſe Propoſals of the Prince, proving of too hard Digeſtion at White-Hall, the Offer of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was thought to be Deſigned only to gain time, and the Romiſh Councellors perceiving that this would not obtain, began to think of other meaſures; So that the Child being ſent for back from Portſmouth to White-Hall in great haſte, the Queen having made up
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42023:62"/>her Equipage Dec. 10. took her Solemn Leave of the King, and with the pretended Prince of Wales, and her Attendants (whereof it is ſaid, Father Peters was one) but it was thought with a large proportion of Treaſure and Jewels: She Croſſed the Water at Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, where three Coaches with Six Horſes awaited them, and with a Strong Guard went to Greenwich, and ſo to Graves-End; where ſhe and her Retinue Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a Yatch for France, and Landed the next Day about four a Clock in the Afternoon; the Queen and ſeveral Courtiers being gone, the Popiſh Prieſts began to ſhift for themſelves; and the ſame Night, the King called an Extraordinary Council, and ſent for the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London, Charging them to preſerve the Peace and Quiet of the City, as much as in them lay, after which they were Diſmiſt; But the Council continued their Debates upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigency of Affairs a great while longer, and were ordered to meet again the next Morning, when to the Surprize of the City and Kingdom: About three a Clock in the Morning, the King took Barge at the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Stairs, with a ſmall Equipage, and went down the River, without being ſo much as known to many of the Officers of his Houſhold, who were then in wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whoſe ſudden Departure, may be ſuppoſed to be occaſioned by the News that Alarm'd the Court the Day before, that the Princes Forces had made their way through Beading, and gain'd the Paſs of Twyford-Bridg, without any Conſiderable Reſiſtance; for about 1500 Horſe, and three Troops of Dragoons being Quartered in the Town of Reading, they had notice that a Detatchment of the Princes Army were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up towards them, which put them into ſuch a Conſternation, that not finding themſelves ſtrong enough to maintain the Town, the Officers upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, Concluded to draw off and make good their Poſt at Twyford-Bridge; out their Scouts coming in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42023:63"/>with News, that the Roads were clear, the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ordered a Scoten Regiment of Horſe, and the Iriſh Dragoons to march back, and Repoſſeſs themſelves of Reading, which they did, and were placed in the Market-place, and other Poſts, continuing on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back moſt part of the Night, to prevent Surprize; yet hearing no more of the Princes Advanced Party, their Officers ordered them to alight and refreſh themſelves and their Horſes; But about ten in the Morning, the Trumpet Sounded to Horſe, the Princes Forces being at the Towns-end, almoſt before they were Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thereupon ſharp Firing began on both ſides, the Iriſh Dragoons bearing the Brunt of the Encounter, and though the Scotch Horſe in ſmall Detached Bodies, made ſome Fire; yet they were over-poured, driven out of Town, and obliged to Retreat to Twyford-Bridge; and at length, many of the Kings Party De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and the reſt were Conſtrained to quit the Paſs, and make the beſt of their Retreat, there being about thirty killed, and ſeveral wounded in this Skirmiſh.</p>
               <p>Upon this ill Succeſs, and the King having no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Forces left, the Day before his going away, he ſent a Letter to his General, the Earl of Feverſham to this Effect;
<q>That things being come to that Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he had been forced to ſend away the Queen and his Son, the Prince of Wales, leſt they ſhould fall into his Enemies Hands: He was reſolved to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf the beſt he could; that if he could have relyed on all his Troops, he was reſolved to have had at leaſt one Blow for it; But that his Lordſhip knew, that both his Lordſhip, and ſeveral of the General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army had told him, that it was not ſafe to venture himſelf at the Head of his Troops, or to think to fight the Prince of Orange with them; and therefore it only remained for him, to thank thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers that had been truly Loyal to him; not expecting they ſheuld farther expoſe themſelves
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42023:63"/>in reſiſting a Foreign Enemy, and a Poyſoned Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> In purſuance of this Letter, the Earl of Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham ſent another to his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, to let him underſtand,
<q>That he had received a Letter from the King, with the unfortunate News of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to go out of England, and he was actually gone, with Orders to make no Oppoſition againſt any Body; which he thought Convenient to let his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs know, ſo ſoon as it was poſſible, to hinder the effuſion of Blood, having already given Order to that purpoſe, to all the Troops under his Command, which would be the laſt Order they ſhould receive from him, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>The Kings Departure being publickly known, the Multitude got together in divers places, as is uſual in ſuch Diſturbances and Diſſolutions of Government, Spoiling and Demoliſhing the new erected Maſs-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Chappels, pulling down, Burning and Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before them; they pluckt down the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent for Monks at St. John's, which had been two years in Building, at vaſt Expence, and burnt the greateſt part of the Timber and Materials in Smithfield, having before Seized upon the Goods, as they were Removing, and burnt them in Holborn; they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Defaced the Chappels in Limeſtreet, and Lincolns Inn Fields, with that of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors at Wild-Houſe, where ſome common Thieves mixing with the more harmleſs Boys, they got great ſtore of Plunder in Plate, Money, and Rich Goods; They likewiſe committed Violences at the Lodgings of the Reſident of the Duke of Florence, and much Defaced the Dwelling-Houſes of ſeveral Eminent Papiſts, who were fled for fear of being Secured, and though the Magiſtrates Laboured to quiet theſe Tumults and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: Yet they found their Authority too weak, till the Mobile had in ſome meaſure vented their Rage, they being grown ſo Numerous, that neither the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42023:64"/>Watches nor Trained Bands, thought it ſafe to oppoſe their Fury.</p>
               <p>Therefore for Redreſs of theſe Miſchiefs, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal then in Town Repaired to Guild-Hall and ſending for Colonel Skelton, then Lieutenant of the Tower, Demanded the Keys, which being by him readily Reſigned, they committed the Charge of that Important Place, to the Lord Lucas, a Perſon of known Honour and Integrity to his Country; Nor were they leſs Active, in Suppreſſing thoſe Lawleſs Rioters: So that in a ſhort time, they were all Diſperſed and Quelled, and ſome of the Principal committed to Priſon; and then taking into Conſideration, the Great and Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conjuncture of the Time, in regard of the Kings having withdrawn himſelf, they drew up a Declaration to this Effect:
<q>That they did Reaſonably hope, that the King having Iſſued out his Proclamation, and Writs for Calling a Free Parliament, they might have reſted ſecurely under the Expectation of that Meeting; but that the King having withdrawn himſelf, as they apprehended, in Order to his Departure out of the Kingdom, by the Pernicious Councils of Perſons ill Affected to the Nation, they cannot without being wanting to their Duty, be ſilent under the Calamities, wherein the Popiſh Councils which have ſo long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, had miſerably involved them; and therefore unanimouſly reſolved to apply themſelves to his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, who with ſo great Kindneſs to theſe Kingdoms, ſo vaſt Expence, and ſo much Hazard to his own Perſon, had undertaken (by endeavouring to procure a Free Parliament) to Reſcue them with as little Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, as poſſible from the Imminent Dangers of Popery and Slavery; Declaring further, that they would with their utmoſt Endeavours, Aſſiſt his Highneſs in the Obtaining of ſuch a Parliament with all Speed; wherein their Laws, Liberties, and Properties might
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42023:64"/>be ſecured, the Church of England in particular, with a due Liberty to Proteſtant Diſſenters; and in General, the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, over the whole World, might be Supported and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, to the Glory of God, the Happineſs of the Eſtabliſhed Government, and the Advantage of all Princes and States in Chriſtendom, that may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Concerned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was Signed by the Archbiſhops of York and Canterbury, 22 Temporal Lords, and 5 Biſhops; and the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Weymouth, Lord Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Ely, and the Dord Culpeper were Ordered to Attend his Highneſs with the ſaid Declaration, at Henley upon Thames; the ſame Day the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, Aſſembled in the ſame place, and Drew up an Humble Addreſs to be Preſented to his Highneſs in their Names, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the City; of like Effect with the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, four Aldermen being appointed to Wait upon the Prince therewith and the Lieutenancy of London meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Day alſo, Drew up an Addreſs to his Highneſs, on the behalf of themſelves and the reſt of the Militia, to the like purpoſe, which were accordingly Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prince, and very favourably Received, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his Highneſs Protection, and beſeeching him to Repair to the City; where he would be received with Univerſal Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The next day the Tumults being ſomewhat allayed, ſearch was made in divers places, for ſuch as were fled from Juſtice; and among others, to the great Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the People, the Lord Chancellor Jeffery's, was taken in an obſcure Houſe at Wapping, Diſguiſed like a Saylor, and endeavouring to make his Eſcape in a Veſſel that lay there for Hamburg; who being brought before the Lord Mayor with a Numerous and inraged Guard of Attendants, his Lordſhip was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Seized with ſuch a frightful Indiſpoſition, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42023:65"/>he was incapable of examining the Matter: So that the Chancellor was carryed to the Tower by his own Conſent, to preſerve himſelf from the Fury of the Rabble.</p>
               <p>Dec. 14. His Highneſs by eaſy Marches came to Windſor, where he was received with all kind of Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Submiſſion by the Mayor and Aldermen in their Formalities, and Congratulated in an Elegant Speech, the Prince of Denmarks Lodgings being provided for his Reception; whilſt his Highneſs was preparing for London, he had notice that the King deſigning to paſs the Seas in Diſguiſe, having betaken himſelf (accompanyed only by two or three Perſons) in a ſmall Veſſel to Sea, was forced by foul Weather, upon the Coaſt of Kent, near Feverſham, and as ſoon as he came to that Town, was ſeized upon by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, there being a Report at that time, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons were making their Eſcapes out of the Land, and being ignorant who he was, they carryed him to a Houſe in the Town, rifling him of ſome Jewels, a conſiderable quantity of Gold, and his Crucifix which he very much valued; but at laſt, the King being known by a Gentleman who came to ſee the Priſoners they had taken, and fell on his Knees to pay him Duty the Common People were ſtrangely Surprized, a great number inſtantly retiring, and others begged his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, offering to reſtore what they had taken from him; but the King refuſed to take his Gold again, giving it them freely: However his Perſon was detained till the News of his being there could be carryed to London.</p>
               <p>The Lords who firſt Aſſembled in the City, being then at White-Hall, and having notice of it, ſent the Lords, Feverſham, Alesbury, Yarmouth and Middleton to the King, with their earneſt Deſires, that he would be pleaſed to return to his Royal Pallace at London, to which, though at firſt he ſhewed ſome unwillingneſs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42023:65"/>yet being preſſed thereto, he at length Condeſcended, the Servants of his Houſhold, who went along with the Lords, having brought him Money and Cloaths, thoſe he had being Old, and rent in the Searching him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was known; But His Highneſs the Prince of Orange, being fully Determined to come to London with all ſpeed, it was upon Conſultation thought very inconvenient, in regard it might Create daily Diſputes and Quarrels between the Souldiers of both Parties, and in divers other Reſpects for the King and himſelf, to be there at one and the ſame time, therefore upon notice of the Kings returning, Monfr. Zaleſtein was ſent to meet him on the way, and to intreat him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Rocheſter, which the King would certainly have done, had not Mounſieur Zuleſtein miſſed him, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Road: So that the King Arrived at White-Hall on Sunday, Dec. 16. in the Evening, attended by three Troops of the Life-Guard, and a Troop of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers, a Set of Boys following him through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and making ſome Huzza's, while the reſt of the People ſilently looked on; From thence the King ſent the Earl of Feverſham to the Prince then at Windſor, to invite his Highneſs to come to St. James's, and take that Pallace as his Reſidence, with what number of Troops he thought Convenient; The Prince Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the Lords about this Meſſage, was adviſed by no means to accept of this Invitation, and there being a neceſſity his Highneſs ſhould be in Town the next Day, the following Paper Signed by the Prince, was ordered to be carryed the King the next day by the Lords therein mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We Deſire you, the Lord Marqueſs of Hallifax, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and the Lord Delamer, to tell the King that it is thought Convenient for the greater Safety of his Perſon, that he do remove to Ham, where he ſhall be Attended by Guards, who
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42023:66"/>will be ready to preſerve him from any Diſturbance. Given at Windſor, Dec. 17. 1688.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And further to prevent the poſſibility of any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, it was reſolved, that his Highneſſes Guards ſhould be poſſeſt of all the Poſts and Avenues about White-Hall before the Paper was delivered, and it was Computed that theſe Guards might have reached White-Hall by eight a Clock at Night, but they were ſo hindred by the foulneſs of the ways, that it was paſt ten before they arrived, and there being difficulty made of withdrawing the Kings Guards, ſo much time was ſpent that the Lords could not proceed in their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage till paſt twelve, ſo that the King was in bed; but to preſerve Decency and Reſpect, and not break haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in upon him, they ſent the Lord Middleton, his Principil Secretary of State, the following Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lord, There is a Meſſage to be delivered to his Majeſty from the Prince, which is of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that we who are charged with it, deſire we may be immedlately admitted, and therefore deſire to know where we may find your Lordſhip, that you may introduce, My Lord, your Lordſhips moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Middleton upon the Receipt hereof, came and introduced them to the King, and their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips having made an Apology, for coming at a time that might diſturb him, the Princes Meſſage was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the King, who reading it ſaid, that he would readily comply; the Lords as they were directed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired, that if it might be with his Majeſties Conveniency, he would be pleaſed to remove ſo early, as to be at Ham by Noon, thereby to prevent his meeting the Prince in his way to London; to this the King readily agreed, and aſked if he might not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42023:66"/>King, who told them, He had forgot to acquaint them with his Reſolution before the Meſſage came, to ſend the Lord Godolphin the next Morning to the Prince, to propoſe his going back to Rocheſter, he finding by the Meſſage Monſieur Zuleſtein was charged with, that the Prince had no Mind he ſhould be at London, and therefore he now deſired that he might rather return to Rocheſter; The Lords replied, that they would immediately ſend an account to the Prince, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of an Anſwer to his Satisfaction, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſparching a Meſſonger to the Prince, who was then at Ston Houſe, the Sieur Benting by eight next Morning, ſent a Letter by the Princes Order, agreeing to the Kings Propoſal, and the Guards and Barges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared to attend him, and his Coaches and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters to follow, he reached Graveſend on the eighteenth in the Evening, and paſſed over Land in his Coach at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Earl of Arran and ſeveral others, and made his Reſidence in Sir Richard Heads Houſe.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon of the ſame day, his Highneſs with a very ſplendid Equipage, and a numerous attendance arrived at St. Jameſes, and received the Congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Nobility, and Perſons of Chiefeſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Town; the People crowding to ſee their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, and expreſſing their Satisfaction at ſo Happy a Revolution, by Ringing of Bells, Bonfires and all the publick Demonſtrations of joy imaginable.</p>
               <p>A Remarkable Accident happened between the Kings firſt going to Rocheſter, and his return to London, a general Alarm being given one Night about Midnight, at almoſt one and the ſame time in the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cities and Towns in England, upon pretence that the Iriſh were Killing, Burning and Deſtroying all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which ſeem'd to be carried on induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Perſons ſet on purpoſe to ſpread that falſe Report, or elſe it can hardly be imagined, how it ſhould have been done at ſo many diſtant places at once, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42023:67"/>threw the People into a great Surprize, and Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, till the day appeared and Convinced them of the Fallacy; But the real occaſion hereof was never yet generally underſtood.</p>
               <p>Upon the Arrival of his Highneſs, the Common Council of London aſſembled, and unanimouſly agreed, that the Sheriffs and all the Aldermen of the City with their Deputies, and two Common Council Men for each Ward, ſhould wait on and Congratulate his Highneſs, upon his Happy Arrival in the Name of the City of London, and accordingly Dec. 20, the Lord Mayor being indiſpoſed by Sickneſs, Sir George Treby the Recorder, in a moſt Elegant Speech, thus Addreſt his Highneſs.</p>

I might have expected ſomewhat better Uſage after what I writ to the Prince of Orange by my Lord Feverſham, and the Inſtructions I gave him; but inſtead of an Anſwer, ſuch as I might have hoped for, What was I to expect after the Uſage I received by the making the ſaid Earl a Priſoner, againſt the Practice and Law of Nations; The ſending his own Guards at Eleven at Night to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts at Whitehall, without advertiſing Me in the leaſt manner of it; The ſending to Me at One a Clock, after Midnight, when I was in Bed, a kind of an Order by Three Lords, to be gone out of Mine Own Palace before Twelve that ſame Morning? After all this, How could I hope to be ſafe, ſo long as I was in the Power of one, who had not only done this to Me, and Invaded My Kingdoms without any juſt Occaſion given him for it, but that did by his firſt Declaration lay the greateſt Aſperſion upon Me that Malice could invent, in that Clauſe of it which concerns My Son? I appeal to all that know Me, nay, even to himſelf, that in their Conſciences, neither he nor they can believe Me in the leaſt capable of ſo unnatural a Villany, nor of ſo little common Senſe, to be impoſed on in a thing of ſuch a Nature as that. What had I then to expect from one who by all Arts hath taken ſuch pains to make Me appear as black as Hell to My Own People, as well as to all the World beſides?

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42023:69"/>to lie upon the Countrey; The Meſſage for his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from Whitehall was managed, as we have heard, with all the reſpect and decency imaginable, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary upon ſeveral accounts, as well as for the preſervation of his own Perſon, whoſe late Actions eſpecially his extraordinary Severity in the Weſt, had raiſed him many inveterate Enemies, who now might have taken the opportunity of offering Violence to him; that his Highneſs had ſufficient Reaſon for this Glorious Expedition, the King had made the Nation too ſenſible of; and as to the buſineſs of the Child, it is well known that his Zeal for the Catholick Cauſe made him ſhut his Eyes to all other Conſiderations whatſoever, and beſides it was managed with ſuch a number of Suſpitious Circumſtances, that we are told one of his own Commanders in Ireland ſhould ſay,

               <p>And now to fill up this Breach and Rupture in the Government, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately met in the Houſe of Peers at Weſtminſter, where they drew up an Humble Addreſs, which they preſented to his Highneſs, Requeſting him in this Conjuncture, to take upon him the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Publick Affairs, both Civil and Military; and the Diſpoſal of the Publick Revenue, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Proteſtant Religion, Rights, Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Properties, and the Peace of the Nation, and to take into his particular Care, the preſent Condition of Ireland, and to uſe Speedy and Effectual means to prevent the danger threatning that Kingdom.</p>

               <p>His Highneſs likewiſe ſent for all ſuch as had been Members of Parliament, in the Reign of Charles the II. together with the Aldermen and Common-Council of the City of London, to meet him at St James's, to adviſe the beſt manner how to purſue the ends of his Declaration, in Calling a Free Parliament, for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and Setling the ſame, that they may not be in Danger of being again Subverted. Upon which, they met accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and after his Highneſs had thus Graciouſly expreſt himſelf to them, they inſtantly Concluded to go to the Houſe of Commons, where being Sate, they choſe Henry Powle Eſq; their Chair-man, and then drew up an Addreſs to the Prince, returning his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their hearty Thanks, and expreſſing their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Acknowledgment; for the Care he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, Humbly Intreating him to take upon him the Adminiſtration of the Government, &amp;c. which being preſented to his Highneſs at St. James's, he returned the ſame anſwer, as he had done to the Lords.</p>
               <p>The News of his Highneſs Sncceſs, and Proſperous proceedings Arriving in Holland, all the Perſons of Quality that were at the Hague, appeared at Court to Complement Her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs of Orange thereupon, and ſoon after their Electoral Highneſſes of Brandenburg arrived there, and were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42023:71"/>Entertained very Splendidly upon that Occaſion; And the States General, ſent three Deputies to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to Congratulate his Highneſs, who Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Tower, were received with the Diſcharge of the Cannon, and Conducted to the Lodgings appointed for them, with a very Spleudid Equipage.</p>
               <p>Dec. 30. His Highneſs Iſſued out a Declaration, to Authorize Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, and all other Officers, except Papiſts, to Continue and Act in their Reſpective Places, till further Order; And a ſecond Declaration, for the better Quartering of Souldiers: That none ſhould be Quartered upon Private Houſes, without the free and voluntary Conſent of the Owner; And a while after, the following Aſſociation for the Preſervation of his Highneſſes Perſon, which had been promoted, and Signed through moſt Counties of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, with great Cheerfulneſs and Alacrity, was Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by ſeveral Noblemen and others, at St. James's.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We whoſe Names are hereunto Subſcribed, who have Joyned with the Prince of Orange, for the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion; and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Ancient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland and Ireland: Do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to Almighty God, to his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, and to one another, to ſtick firm to this Cauſe, and to one another in Defence of it; and never to depart from it till our Religion, our Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo far ſecured to us in a Free Parliament, that we ſhall be no more in Danger of Falling under Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery; And whereas we are ingaged in this Common Cauſe, under the Protection of the Prince of Orange; by which means his Perſon may be expoſed to Dangers, and to the Deſperate and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Attempts of the Papiſts, and other Bloody Men: We do therefore Solemnly engage, both to God and to one another, that if any ſuch Attempts are made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42023:71"/>him, we will purſue not only thoſe that make them, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms againſt us, with the utmoſt Severities of a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to their Ruin, and final Deſtruction; and that the Execution of any ſuch Attempt (which God of his Mercy forbid) ſhall not divert us from proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Cauſe, which we do now undertake; but that it ſhall ingage us to carry it on with all the vigor that ſo Barbarous a Practice ſhall deſerve.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, His Highneſs publiſhed a Declaration, to Command all Papiſts to depart within three Days out of London and Weſtminſter, and Ten Miles about, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalty of Suffering, the utmoſt Severity of the Law, and about the ſame time, the Country People Seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great number of Perſons in Kent and other places, endeavouring to make their eſcape beyond Sea, who were committed to ſeveral Priſons, till further Order. And to ſhew the readineſs and zeal of the People to Support his Highneſs: He had no ſooner ſignified to the City of London, that the neceſſary Expences he had been at, had near exhauſted the publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; but that they inſtantly ordered a Committee to attend him, to know what Sum might be neceſſary, and 100000 l. being Named, the Generous Citizens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came to Guild-Hall, and made Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for 300000 l. which was paid in to Admiration, within a very few days.</p>
               <p>Affairs being now in a promiſing way of ſettlement in England, let us take a brief view of Scotland, to whom his Highneſs before his arrival had likewiſe ſent a Declaration to the ſame effect with that ſent to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſome Expreſſions only being varied according to the different Circumſtances of both Nations; his Highneſs declaring,
<q>That by the influence of thoſe evil Counſellors, who deſigned to render themſelves the abſolute Maſters of the Lives, Honours, and Eſtates of the Subjects without being reſtrained by any Rule
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42023:72"/>or Law, a moſt exorbliant Power had been exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in impoſing Bonds and Oaths upon whole Shires; In permitting Free Quarters to Souldiers; In impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Gentlemen without any Reaſon, forcing them to accuſe and witneſs againſt themſelves; In impoſing Arbitrary Fines, frighting and hareſſing many parts of the Countrey, with intercommuning, making ſome incur the forfeiture of Life and Fortune for the moſt general and harmleſs converſe even with their neareſt Relations Outlawed; Impowering Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to act upon the Subjects, living in quiet, and full Peace the greateſt Barbarities, in deſtroying them by Hanging, Shooting, and drowning them without any Form of Law, or reſpect to Age or Sex, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome of them time to pray to God for Mercy; and this for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they would not anſwer or ſatisfie them in ſuch Queſtions, as they propoſed to them, without any warrant of Law, and againſt the common Intereſt of mankind, which frees all men from being obliged to diſcover their ſecret Thoughts, beſides a great many other Violences and Oppreſſions, to which that poor Nation hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without any hope of having any end put to them, or to have relief from them. And that the Arbitrary and illegal Proceedings of there Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors might be juſtified, ſuch a Declaration hath been procured by them, as ſtrikes at the root of the Government, and overturns the moſt Sacred Rights of it; in making all Parliaments unncreſſary, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all Defences of Religion, Liberty, and Property. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>This Letter being read and approved of the Lords and Commons preſented an Addreſs to his Highneſs;

               <p>As to the Condition of Ireland, the Earl of Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel a violent Papiſt, being made Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom by King James, as a fit Inſtrument to carry on his Deſigns, gave the Iriſh great Hopes of Subduing the Engliſh, by his firſt Caſhiering the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Officers and Souldiers that were in Arms, and then by turning out the Officers and Miniſters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and though Complaints were made againſt his proceedings in the Court of England; yet they were not regarded, but he rather incouraged in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, which occaſioned ſuch Dread of future Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, that divers left the Kingdom, ſome going for Holland, others for Scotland and England; things continued in this Dangerous poſture, till the News of the intended Enterprize of the Prince of Orange Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, upon which Tyrconnel was very active to ſecure the Roman Catholick Intereſt in Ireland, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning and Diſarming the Proteſtants, and ſending over 3000 of the Choiceſt Iriſh Souldiers to Aſſiſt King James. But upon notice of his Flight into France, he called his Popiſh Council together, and told them, That now was the time for their ſtanding up for their Country, to ſecure it againſt all their Enemies; and as for his part, if his Maſter himſelf, ſhould command him to deliver up the Sword, he ſhould think it his Duty to refuſe it in this Juncture; and thereupon ſpreading the News all over the Country, he cauſed the Iriſh every where to Arm themſelves with ſuch Weapons as they could get; This Tumultuous Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Herding together, plundred the Proteſtants Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, drove away their Cattle, fired their Stack; of Corn and Hay, Murthered ſome, and Barbarouſly uſed others; inſomuch, that the Proteſtants being extreamly affrighted, many of them fled for their Lives, leaving their Eſtates behind them, and though ſeveral of the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry made Head in the North: Yet they found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42023:74"/>to Reſiſt the Fury of their Numerous Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; However they Defeated ſeveral Parties of Iriſh, and Fortified London-Derry, Slego, the Iſle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſkilling, and other places which they thought Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; For now Tyrconnel gave Order for ſtopping the Ports, to prevent any more from going away, and made many large and plauſible Propoſals, to induce them to join with him, though they had very little effect upon them.</p>
               <p>The Convention at Weſtminſter, were ſtill upon ſerious Debates about the preſent Condition of the Kingdom, and in the mean time it was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to have the Preſence of Her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs of Orange in England; Whereupon a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Engliſh and Dutch Men of War, were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to wait upon her, till her Equipage could be got ready, and the Wind ſerved to bring over her Highneſs; And after the Lords and Commons had duly weighed the Circumſtances of the Kings Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they at length came to the following Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>

               <p>It is Reported, that his Majeſty ſhould thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly expreſs himſelf upon this Occaſion:
<q>That though the Regulations ſeem'd ſomewhat harſh, they were eaſy to him that deſired only to be a great King; But in reſpect to one that Aim'd to be a Tyrant, they were not ſtrict enough.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus brought their Majeſty to the Throne, let us make a few Remarks upon this Wonderful and Unparallel'd Revolution, and ſo conclude the Hiſtory of the Houſe of Orange;</p>
               <p>Had a Prince of leſs Secreſie, Prudence, Courage and Intereſt, undertaken this mighty Affair, it might probably have miſcarryed; but as his Cauſe was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo his Reputation, Conduct and Patience, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42023:78"/>exceeded that of King James; He would not ſtir till he ſaw the French Forces ſit down before Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsburg, and that he was ſure France and Germany were irrecoverably ingaged; and that he ſhould have no other Oppoſition, than what the Iriſh and Engliſh Roman Catholicks could make againſt him; For no Engliſh Proteſtant would fight his Country into Vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and Slavery, to Popiſh Prieſts and Italian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; when a Parliament ſooner or later muſt have Determined every thing in Controverſy, except they were Reſolved once for all, to have given up their Religion, Laws, Liberties and Eſtates, to the Will of their Arbitrary Kings, and ſubmitted for ever to a French Government; and indeed, a Nation of leſs Senſe than the Engliſh, might have been impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Of leſs Bravery and Valour, might have been frighted; Of a more Servile Temper, might have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their Liberties, till it had been too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them again; And none but a parcel of Jeſuits, unacquainted with their Temper and Conſtitution, would ever have hoped to have carryed two ſuch things as Popery and Arbitrary Power, both at once, upon a People ſo Jealous as the Engliſh are; and who hate Idolatry and Tyranny, above any Nation in the World.</p>
               <p>As for King James II. had he undertaken any thing but theſe two, his vaſt Revenue, his Reputed Perſonal Valour, and the Fame he had gained both at Home and Abroad, by the Defeat of Monmouths Invaſion, would have gone near to have effected it; And after all, if he had in the beginning of October, freely granted all the Propoſals made him by the Nobility, and ſuffered a Parliament to have met, and given up his Evil Miniſters to Juſtice, and permitted the Birth of the pretended Prince of Wales to have been freely Debated and Determined in Parliament, it would in all probability, have prevented this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42023:78"/>of the Prince of Orange; But whilſt he thought to preſerve the pretended Succeſſion, the Diſpenſing and Suſpending Power, and the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Commiſſion, to promote his future De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, when he had once baffled the Prince of Orange, the Nation ſaw through the Project, and he loſt all.</p>
               <p>As for the Engliſh in general, their Intereſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the maintaining the Rights and Franchiſes of their Kingdom; which renders them this Day the freeſt Nation in Europe; A Character ſo far from ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be like other Nations, a People Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and unconſtant, that it ſhews them to be the moſt Conſiderate and Underſtanding People in the World; in ſhort, though the example of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Prince, had ſerved for a Platform for other Crowned Heads, to enlarge their Power beyond the Limits preſcribed by the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom: We ſee that at the very Moment, that the King began to act like his Neighbour, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>op to his Deſigns, without the leaſt reſpect to his Dignity; They ſaw how Soveraign Authority Reigned in France, as Independent from the Laws, as in Turkey: They beheld the face of the Kingdom of Sweden and Denmark, changed by Introducing Hereditary Succeſſion, whereas they were Elective before; They viewed the Face of the Kingdom of Hungary, heretofore the Seat of Liberty, Disfigured by the ſame Innovation; and Poland that boaſts to have preſerved the Ancient Laws entire, has notwithſtanding ſuffered Injurious Alterations; In ſhort, which way ſoever we caſt our Eyes, we ſhall find Attempts of the ſame Nature proſper, only in England they have failed; whence we may conclude that maugre all which has been ſaid of the Engliſh Nation, they are the Wiſeſt, and moſt Prudent People that we know of under the Sun.</p>

They proceeded to enact ſeveral Laws for ſetling the Government upon its true and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Baſis; and ſeveral vacant Offices and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſupplied by their Majeſties, and Dr. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Burnet was made Biſhop of Saliſbury in the room of Dr. Seth Ward Deceaſed.</p>
            <p>I have been very brief upon the Affairs in England, till the Happy Revolution in 1688. becauſe I have lately Publiſhed a Book of the ſame value with this, Intituled.</p>

            <p>In anſwer hereto, the King aſſured them of his great eſteem and affection for Parliaments, eſpecially for this, which would be much increaſed by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they ſhewed to him, and their zeal for the publick good, and that he would never abuſe the Confidence they put in Him, nor give any Parliament cauſe to diſtruſt Him, becauſe he would never expect any thing from them, but what it was their Intereſt to grant; that He came hither for the good of the Kingdom, and ſince, by their deſire, he was in that Station, he would full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſame ends that brought him; that God had been pleaſed to make him inſtrumental to redeem them from the Ills they feared, and it was ſtill his deſire as well as his duty to endeavour to preſerve their Religion, Laws,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42023:81"/>and Liberties, which were the only inducements that brought him into England, and to thoſe he did aſcribe the Bleſſings that had attended this undertaking; he then remainded them of Aſſiſting his Allies, eſpecially the Dutch, and to conſider the Deplorable Condition of Ireland; which by the Zeal and Violence of the Popiſh Party, and the Aſſiſtance and Incouragement of the French, required a conſiderable force to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, &amp;c. and that a Fleet may be likewiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which in Conjunction with the States, might make us entire Maſters of the Seas; and as they freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Hazard all that is dear to them, ſo he ſhould as freely expoſe his Life for the Support of the Proteſtant Religion and the Safety and Honour of the Nation.</p>
            <p>In Scotland, the Viſcount Dundee having made his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from Edinburgh, went to the North, where he ſtirred up the Highlanders to joyn with him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for King James; upon which the Convention or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a number of Horſe, Foot and Dragoons to march againſt them, and in the mean time, the Lord Roſs, who was ſent with a Letter to King William in England, returned, and brought an anſwer thereto; After which, the Eſtates drew up an Inſtrument of Government, for Setling the Crown upon King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Queen Mary; Wherein they Recapitulate their Grievances, and propoſe Remedies for the ſame; And then declare;
<q>That King James the 7th. being a profeſſed Papiſt, did Aſſume the Royal Power, and acted as King, without ever taking the Oath required by Law, and hath by Advice of Evil and Wicked Councellers, Invaded the Fundamental Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kingdom, and altered it from a Legal Limited Monarchy, to an Arbitrary Deſpotick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and did exerciſe the ſame, to the Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Violation of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, inverting all the ends of Government, whereby he hath Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted

            <p>
               <q>When I Engaged in this Undertaking, I had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Regard and Conſideration for Scotland, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did emit a Declaration in relation to that as well as to this Kingdom, which I intend to make good and

            <p>The Meeting of the Eſtates of Scotland, did Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe their Commiſſioners to repreſent to his Majeſty, That that Clauſe in the Oath in relation to the rooting out of Hereticks, did not import the deſtroying of Hereticks; and that by the Law of Scotland, no Man was to be Perſecuted for his private Opinion; and even Obſtinate and Convicted Hereticks, were only to be Denounced Rebels or Outlawed, whereby their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Eſtates are Confiſcated.

               <q>Gentlemen, I receive this Addreſs, as a Mark of the Confidence you have in me, which I take very kindly, and ſhall endeavour by all my Actions to Confirm you in it, I aſſure you, that my own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſhall never be an Argument to incline me to ingage in a War that may expoſe the Nation either to Danger or Expence; but in the preſent Caſe, I look upon the War ſo much already declared in effect by France againſt England, that it is not ſo much an Act of Choice, as an inevitable neceſſity in our own Defence; I ſhall only tell you, that as I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured my Life, and all that is Dear to me, to reſcue the Nation from what it ſuffered, ſo I am ready ſtill to do the ſame, in order to the preſerving it from all its Enemies; and as I doubt not of ſuch an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from you, as ſhall be Suitable to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me, to Declare War againſt a powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo you may Rely upon me, that no part of that which you ſhall give for the carrying it on with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſhall by me be Diverted to any other uſe.</q>

            <p>Soon after a Declaration of War was publiſhed againſt France, and the Reaſons thereof, Namely,
<q>The unjuſt Methods of the French King, theſe late years to gratifie his Ambition, by Invading the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Empire now in Amity with us, and in manifeſt Violation of the Treaties Confirmed by the Guaranty of the Crown of England: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty therefore can do no leſs than joyn with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in Oppoſing that Kings Deſigns, as the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Peace, and the Common Enemy of the Chriſtian World; Likewiſe the many Injuries done to his Majeſty and his Subjects, are a ſufficient Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for their taking Arms, ſince they have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42023:84"/>upon his Majeſty ſo to do; and though no notice has been taken, nor Reparation demanded of late years, for Reaſons well known to the World; yet his Majeſty will not paſs them over, without a publick and juſt Reſentment of ſuch Outrages. Alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and Invaſions of the French on our Trade and Fiſhing of Newfound Land, and their Hoſtilities upon the Charibbee Iſlands, New York, and Hudſons-Bay, Seizing the Forts, burning the Houſes, Robbing the Engliſh of their Goods, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning ſome, inhumanly killing others, and driving the reſt to Sea in a ſmall Veſſel, without Food or Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and this even at a time when that King was Negotiating a Treaty in England. of Neutrality and good Correſpondence in America; alſo his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the Seizure of Engliſh Ships by French Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers; His Diſputing the Right of the Flag in the Narrow Seas; which in all Ages, has been aſſerted by his Majeſties Predeceſſors, and which he is reſolved to maintain for the Honour of the Crown, and of the Engliſh Nation, And that which moſt nearly touches his Majeſty, is, His Unchriſtian Perſecution of many Engliſh Proteſtants in France, contrary to the Law of Nations, and expreſs Treaties, forcing them to abjure their Religion, by ſtrange and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Cruelties, impriſoning ſome Engliſh Maſters and Seamen, and Condemning other to the Gallies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of having on Board either the Perſons or Goods of ſome of his own Miſerable Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Laſtly, as he has for ſome years paſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Inſinuation and Promiſes of Aſſiſtance to overthrow the Government of England, ſo now by Open and Violent Methods, and the actual Invaſion of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Supporting the Rebels there, he is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the utter Extirpation of the Proteſtants there. His Majeſty being therefore thus Neceſſitated to take up Arms, and Relying on the help of Almighty God,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42023:84"/>in his juſt undertaking hath thought fit to declare War againſt the French King, and will in Conjunction with his Allies, vigorouſly proſecute the ſame by Sea and Land (ſince he hath ſo unrighteouſly begun it) being aſſured of the hearty Concurrence and Aſſiſtance of his Subjects, in Supporting of ſo good a Cauſe; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all Correſpondence or Communication with that King or his Subjects; and that all the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Majeſties Dominions, who ſhall Demean themſelves Dutifully, and not Correſpond with his Enemies, ſhall upon the Kings Royal word, be ſafe in their Perſons and Eſtates, and free from all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation and Trouble of any Kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time, the King of Spain proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed War againſt France, and the Emperor of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſent a Letter to his Majeſty, wherein after he has returned thanks to the King for taking care that no Violence ſhould be offered to the Roman Catholicks, he promiſes the ſame thing in reſpect to the Proteſtants; His Majeſty gave Advice to the Switzers, of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Throne; So that now King William and Queen Mary, were acknowledged for lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns of Great Brittain by all the Proteſtant, and the greateſt part of the Roman Catholick Princes and States, for (beſides the Emperor and the King of Spain) the Duke of Bavaria, the three Eccleſiaſtical Electors, the Duke of Newburg, the Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and the Biſhops of Leige and Munſter, all Roman Catholicks, declared themſelves Enemies to France, and by this we may obſerve, that the French Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were greatly deceived in their Meaſures, for upon notice of the Prince of Oranges Expedition into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it is reported, ſome of them thus Diſcourſt King Lewis, Sir, ſaid they,

            <p>King James found himſelf at this time greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Scotland, which he called his Ancient Kingdom, where he thought himſelf abſolute Maſter, by making ſo many Creatures and Friends, whereas that Kingdom in general, now owned King William, and the Rebels whoſe number is inconſiderable, and Diſcovered and Secured; The Lord Dundee only eſcaped who roam'd about the North parts, with ſome few followers, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mackay at his Heels; Letters about this time were intercepted from the late King and his Secretary Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to the Lord Belcarris and others, wherein were ſome Expreſſions that highly incenſed the Scots againſt them;
<q>You will aſk me without queſtion, ſays Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Claverhouſe, How we intend to pay our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but never fear that, ſo long as there are Rebels Eſtates, we will begin with the Great Ones, and end with the Little Ones; In another Letter to Belcarris, ſays he, The Eſtates of the Rebels will Recompence us; Experience hath taught our Illuſtrious Maſter, that there are a good Number of People that muſt be made Gibeonites, becauſe they are good for nothing elſe; you know, there are ſeveral Lords that we markt out, when we were both together, that deſerve no better; Theſe will ſerve for Examples to others;</q> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reading of theſe Letters, the Preſident of the Convention Addreſſing himſelf to the Members of the Aſſembly; <hi>You hear Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Pronounced, and that it behoves us either to Defend our Selves or Dye;</hi> Upon which the Lords Belcarris and

            <p>June 15. The Eſtates of Scotland met after their late Adjournment, and the Duke of Hamilton acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that his Majeſty had been pleaſed to ſend him a Commiſſion to repreſent his Royal Perſon, and that he had Orders to give his Conſent to an Act for the turning the Meeting of the Eſtates into a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was done accordingly, and ſoon after they made an Act for Recognizing and Aſſerting their Majeſties Royal Authority and Right to the Crown, and another for all Perſons to take an Oath of Faith and Allegiance to them; and about the ſame time the Engliſh Forces under General Mackay, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred that Kingdom, the Duke of Gordon, who till this time had Poſſeſſion of the Caſtle finding no hopes of Relief, ſurrendred it upon Articles to Sir John Lanier, and ſo that important place, which ſo long had been a Terror to the City of Edenburgh was put into ſafe hands, the Duke caſting himſelf upon the Kings Mercy without making any Article for himſelf, and it was reported he ſaid,

Major General Mackay Marching

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42023:90"/>fight, perceiving the defeat of his Forces, fled with all ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Dublin with a very few Attendants, and having ſtaid there one Night, filling the place with Fear and Confuſion, upon an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm that King William was on his way thither; accompanied with the Duke of Berwick, the Marquis of Powis and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he left the City and haſtened to Waterford, where a Ship lay ready for him, having neither ſlept nor eat till he got out to Sea, and ſtood away for France. Upon this the Proteſtants at Dublin, who were impriſoned, had their Liberty, and a few days after the King arrived there to the unſpeakable Joy of the People. The loſs of the Engliſh in obtaining this great Victory was not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, only Duke Schoniberg and Doctor Walker were both ſlain; after this Waterford, Wexford, and ſeveral other places were reduced, and upon a Proclamation of Pardon, many of the Iriſh laid down their Arms, and returned to their former Places of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.</p>
            <p>This Glorious ſucceſs was ſomewhat clouded nearer home, for the French King to favour his deſign in Ireland, had now ſet forth the greateſt Fleet that ever ſailed on the Ocean out of France, and ſtood toward our Coaſt, as if they deſigned to fight our Navy under the Earl of Torrington, who June 24 Sailed from St. Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens toward them; they were ſeen the Night before off of Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water gate in the Iſle of Wight, but the Wind taking them ſhort the Admiral came to an Anchor off Dunnoſe, five Leagues off the French, ſo that a battle was ſoon expected which the Enemy did not ſeem to decline, the Engliſh Seamen were alſo full of Courage and deſirous to ingage; but the French being much ſtronger both for number and bigneſs of Ships, conſiſting in 82 Men of War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Fire Ships and Tenders, it was not thought fit to fight in the open Sea, ſo that the Earl of Torrington avoided it, till he was came to Beveſire off Beachy, which was favourable for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and there he received the Queens Orders not to delay inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, if the Wind and Weather would permit, which was the Reaſon, that we went to ſeek the Enemy, who expected us in Order of Battle, and about nine in the Morning, the Ingagement began, the Dutch that had the Vanguard fought bravely, and both ſides fired deſperately three hours, till the French not liking their entertainment bore away with all ſpeed, but about one a Clock, there happened a Calm, which not only prevented the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der purſuit, but put them into a little diſorder; the French not being able to get away were conſtrained to begin the Fight again, which laſted till five in the Evening with extraordinary fury; as for the Engliſh, ſome few fought well; but the Admirals unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſtanding away prevented them from ſeconding the Dutch, ſo that the reſt ſtood Lookers on while the main Body of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42023:91"/>French fell into the Rear of the Dutch, who having fought from Morning till Night, and defended themſelves ſo long againſt a prodigious number of the Enemy that aſſailed them on every ſide, they were ſo much battered that hardly three were capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any defence, which conſtrained them to make their way through the French Fleet to the Coaſt of England; The Hollanders loſt two Admirals and a Captain, and ſome of their Ships that could not be got off were burnt, the Engliſh loſt two Sea and two Marine Captains; Admiral Evertſon declared, that all the Dutch Officers, and Seamen had done their Duties, and had ours inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Heartily, no doubt the French had gone home in a worſe Condition than the Spaniards did in 1588. After the Fight the French Fleet ſailed Weſtward, and ſent their Boats Aſhore at Ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth a ſmall Village of Fiſher Mens Cotts, which they ſet on Fire, with two or three ſmall Veſſels in the Harbour, and ſtealing a few Sheep, after having lain ſome time on our Coaſt to little purpoſe, they returned to Breſt.</p>
            <p>At the time the French lay off the Coaſts of Kent, one Godfrey Croſs an Innkeeper in that County was ſeen to go aboard one of their Boats, which carried him to the Fleet, whereupon at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he was ſeized and Treaſonable Letters being found about him, he was committed Priſoner, and ſoon after tryed for High Treaſon at the Kings Bench Bar Weſtminſter, and being Convict was Hanged and Quartered for the ſame; and care was taken by Her Majeſty, in whom the Regency reſided, during the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to put the Militia of the Counties into ſuch a poſture as to defeat any evil deſigns of the Enemies to the Government; and the Militia of London, conſiſting in about ten thouſand men made a gallant appearance before her Majeſty at Hyde Park, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Chearful Reſolution to defend their Majeſties and the Government againſt all its Opponents, and the whole Militia of England computed to be about one hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe and Foot ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

King James was upon a Hill, and through a Perſpective Glass ſaw the fight, and upon the firſt firing of the Engliſh, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; that it was only a Signal for them to come over to the French but he ſoon found himſelf deceived, and that it was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Ruſſell he had to do withal, and that the Intriagues of his Jacobites had not ſucceeded.

               <hi>May</hi> 15, 1692. <hi>The French Army, after having made many Marches and Countermarches inveſted the ſtrong Fortreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, being incouraged thereto by the treacherous Baron de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, who being born a Subject of Spain, and having received ſome diſguſt from that Court, was corrupted by the French, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his eſcape out of the Town, informed the Enemy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof, which he had got full Information of by his Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Governour, the Prince of Brabancon, ſo as to inform them of the beſt places for the attack, which was ſtrong, and which weak, ſo that the Town was ſurrendered in five days; and awhile after. Williams Fort and the Caſtle were likewiſe delivered up: It is very well known that the King of England took all the pains ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42023:94"/>to get his Army of ſeveral Nations together before the Siege; and that the Duke of Luxemburg, who lay with a ſtrong Detachment to cover the Beſiegers, uſed all manner of Caution to avoid a Battle, by Incamping in places where he could not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, being ſufficiently acquainted with the temper of King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, to whom it was natural to deſpiſe danger, and who puſhed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the relief of the Place to the utmoſt, for as ſoon as be came to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haine, he inſtantly cauſed Bridges to be built in the Night to croſs the River next Morning, and to attack Duke Luxemburg in the Moraſſes: which he had certainly done, if a very extraordinary Rain had not fallen, and if all the Generals had not unanimouſly diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from it, becauſe of the impoſſibility of forming a Line of Battel in a place ſo full of Water; after the ſurrender of Namur, the King being informed, that the Duke of Luxemburg was upon his March from Enguien, reſolved to advance with all ſpeed to the ſame place, but the French got there before him, and poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves between that place and Steinkerken, among Hedges and Woods, however King William reſolved to attack him there, which much ſurprized Luxemburg, who upon view of the advantageous Seitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his Camp, had ſaid,
<q>That none but an Alexander or a Caesar durſt attack him in that place;</q> but it was William the Great who performed that part, and marching ſilently all Night, fell upon the French with ſuch fury next Morning, that in a few hours, above 7000 of the Enemy were ſlain, with a great number of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Officers; and afterwards retreated at leiſure, the French not having the Courage to follow them. So that the attack and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat were equally Glorious, the King having expoſed himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Cannon and Muſkets ſhots where the fight was hotteſt, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding continually from one end to the other to give neceſſary Orders, ſo that it was next to a Miracle that his Sacred Perſon was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among ſo many imminent dangers. Thus His Majeſty glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ended this Campaign by a Signal Victory over the French at Sea, and by having ſeveral times braved his Enemies by land, haraſſing them by his continual Marches, and attacking them in their Retrenchments, ſeeking only an opportunity of putting an end to the War by a General Battle, and ſo to procure to Europe, a ſolid and durable Peace,</hi>

               <hi>On the Contrary, the French King dares never to appear in the Head of his Troops, but endeavours to make himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned by Treachery and Violation of Oaths; Theſe are his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and Aſſaſſinations, and Poiſonings are Crimes, which in that Court are not prohibited, Witneſs the Valet de Chambre, who poiſoned the Duke of Lorrain; the French Cook, who, at the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French Ambaſſador, poiſoned Mr. Harbord, at Belgrade,
